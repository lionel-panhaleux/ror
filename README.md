# REPUBLIC OF ROME Second Edition, Living Rules v1.06

# I. BASIC GAME
## 1.01 Introduction
REPUBLIC OF ROME is a game that captures 250 years of political history during the Roman Republic, from its appearance
on the world stage around the time of the 1st Punic War (264 BC) through its eventual collapse into civil war with the
assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. Players control factions composed of the leading Senatorial families who
compete for state offices, military commands, economic concessions and new adherents. Each player is attempting to
become the dominant political force in Rome. However, the Senate must also attend to the affairs of state in a hostile
world, necessitating a certain amount of cooperation in the prosecution of wars and the maintenance of public
contentment. Failure to do so, especially at the outset when Rome is most vulnerable, may result in the collapse of the
Republic. Therefore, the players must not only out maneuver one another, but also defeat the game itself,
which constitutes an ever-present opponent scheming to divide and defeat them all. Players are advised to keep
the threat of the downfall of the Republic foremost in mind and stand ready to cooperate for the good of the state.
Otherwise, the most likely winner will be the game, and all players will be put to the sword!

**WINNING:** There are multiple ways to win REPUBLIC OF ROME. One common way is for the Senators in your Faction
to accumulate the most combined Influence by the end of the game. However, if a single Senator can accumulate enough
Influence to be elected or appointed Consul for Life, this will usually result in a victory for his Faction.
The most difficult and most dramatic way to win is to gain the allegiance of the formidable Roman Legions,
Revolt against the State and attempt to take the Senate by force!
For more details on Victory Conditions see [1.12.1](#1121-winning).

**LOSING:** Be ever watchful as Rome can fall in a myriad of ways! If the State goes Bankrupt due to poor fiscal policy,
all players lose. If the citizens of Rome ever Revolt due to the poor stewardship of the Senate, all the players lose.
Finally, if, at the end of any turn, Rome is beset by four Active Wars, the Republic will collapse under the strain
and Rome will be no more! For more details on the Losing Conditions see [1.12.2](#1122-losing).

## 1.04 GAME TERMS & CONCEPTS
## 1.04.1 GAME TERMS:
The following terms are used throughout the rules and players should be familiar with them.
The index in the back (Section VII) contains additional game term definitions.

- Faction Card: Any card with red text.
- Forum Card: Any card with black text.
- Talent (T): A denomination of Roman currency.
- HRAO: [Highest Ranking Available Official](#1091-how-the-senate-phase-works).
  The Senator holding the highest ranking office in Rome.
- ASCIR: [Aligned Senator Currently in Rome](#1091-how-the-senate-phase-works).
  The Senators taking part to the Senate session.
- Bank: All the chits and markers that are not in play.
- Faction: A group of Senators belonging to a player.
- Aligned: A Senator belonging to a Faction.
- drm: Modifier applied to any die or dice roll.
- 1d6, 2d6, 3d6: A roll of 1, 2 or 3 six-sided dice.
- Personal Treasury: Talents on a Senator card.
- Faction Treasury: Talents in the Faction Treasury Box.

### 1.04.2 FACTIONS
Each player will control a Faction of Senators, which they will display before them. These Senators have different
attributes that increase a Faction’s voting power and Influence. The black-text Senators represent Families,
while the red-text Senators represent specific Statesmen of the era. Statesmen are treated like Senators but usually
have better attributes and a special power.

Statesmen are either played by themselves or on top of a matching black Family card. As the Game progresses Senators
will gain various markers, Concessions, military commands, and political offices, all with the goal of increasing their
Influence (which can almost be considered victory points).

### 1.04.3 TRADING CARDS
During the course of the Game players will hold secret cards that will make up their hand. Players may trade and/or
give away their held Faction cards only during the [Revolution Phase](#111-revolution-phase)
Players may still show their cards to other players as they wish.

### 1.04.4 TRANSFERRING TALENTS
Players may give Talents to each other only during the [Redistribution step](#1063-redistribution) of the Revenue Phase.

### 1.04.5 VOTE TALLY
Each player should always readjust his Vote Tally dial as soon as he gains or loses votes for any reason.

### 1.04.6 RESOLVING TIES & TURN ORDER
Ties of any nature not resolved by stated secondary considerations are always broken in favor of the highest roller
on 2d6. Disputes about what order players should resolve actions not resolved by stated secondary considerations are
always broken by the HRAO going first and play proceeding clockwise around the board.

### 1.04.7 HIDDEN INFORMATION
Only Talents kept in the Faction Treasury and a player’s hand of Faction cards are hidden. Unless otherwise specified
everything else, including discard piles and Personal Treasuries, are always open for inspection. When a card is
discarded, place it face up on the discard pile.

## 1.05 MORTALITY PHASE
### 1.05.1 IMMINENT WAR ACTIVATION
One of each War (in Matching War order) located in the [Imminent Wars](#10733-wars) box in the Forum
move to the Active Wars box.

### 1.05.2 MORTALITY PHASE DRAW
One Mortality Chit is drawn at random from the cup every Mortality Phase.
Whenever a Mortality Chit is drawn, the chit indicates that the Senator whose numerical ID matches that of the chit
has died. If the named Senator is not in play, there is no effect. In the event you need to draw more than one chit,
these chits are laid out and not returned to the cup until the appropriate number of chits have been drawn.
Once all the needed Mortality Chits have been drawn, the chits are returned to the cup.

### 1.05.3 DEATH CONSEQUENCES
Regardless of the cause of death, all markers are removed from the afflicted Senator’s card. Any Concessions and
Provinces attached to the Senator are placed in the Forum. Any Family card (black-text Senator) is placed under all
other Family cards in the “Repopulating Rome” space in the Curia.
Any [Statesman card](#10731-senators) (red-text Senator) is permanently removed from play.

### 1.05.4 FACTION ELIMINATION
If a Faction has no Senators left, that player may either quit the Game or draw the top Senator card that does not match
a played Statesman in the Curia. If there is none, he can wait and take the first Senator that enters the Curia.

## 1.06 REVENUE PHASE
### 1.06.1 PERSONAL REVENUE
Senators usually generate Personal Revenue. The revenue includes Base Income plus funds from Concessions,
Governorships and Knights. These are given as a lump sum to the player for [Redistribution](#1063-redistribution).

Each Faction (player) collects 2 Talents and all Senators collect 1 Talent apiece.

Each Senator collects from the Bank 1 Talent for each Knight on his card, plus he **must** generate revenue
on each [Concession](#10732-concessions) he controls and he reveals the Concession’s corrupt bar.

Each Governor has the **option** to roll a die or dice to generate that number of Talents of Provincial Spoils from his
Province that turn. A Governor need not pay a negative Provincial Spoils result, in which case the State will during the
[Debits step](#10653-debits) of the Revenue Phase. A Governor who attempts to collect Provincial Spoils from his
Province takes a Corrupt marker.

> EXAMPLE: The Governor of Undeveloped Hispania Ulterior takes a Corrupt marker and rolls a 2 for Provincial Spoils,
> which results in net income of -1 (2 - 3 = -1), but he need not pay any negative totals out of his own funds.
> Total bill to the State Treasury is -1 Talent.

### 1.06.2 REDISTRIBUTION
All Personal Revenue generated, in addition to any existing Talents, may at this point be moved freely
between Personal Treasuries and Faction Treasuries. Money may be transferred to or from Senators who are not in Rome.
Players may give Talents from their Faction Treasury and the Personal Treasuries of their own Senators to other players,
who may then redistribute the Talents as needed.

Talents allocated to the Faction Treasury are placed in the Faction Treasury Box in front of each player.
Faction Treasuries are [secret](#1049-hidden-information) and not available for inspection by other players.

### 1.06.3 PROVINCE DEVELOPMENT
After collecting or declining to collect his Provincial Spoils, the Governor of each Undeveloped (yellow-bordered)
Province must roll 1d6 to see if that Province has been improved by Roman control. There is a +1 DRM to the Improvement
roll if the Governor does not hold a Corrupt marker. If the roll is ≥ 6, the Governor earns 3 Influence and the
Province card is flipped to its Developed (green) side. The new values listed thereon remain in effect for the rest
of the Game. Provinces being attacked cannot be Developed.

### 1.06.4 STATE REVENUES
The players adjust the Treasury markers on the State Treasury track. The State receives 100 Talents Annual Revenue
at the start of each Revenue Phase.

Each Governor rolls dice as indicated on that Province card after “State Income” to determine the number of Talents
in taxes paid to the State by his Province. In some cases, this can be a negative amount and results in the
Treasury Track markers being reduced accordingly. The amount of taxes collected is recorded on the Treasury Track.

Any Senator may contribute money to the State Treasury regardless of the level of the Treasury. In doing so,
a Senator may gain 1 Influence for 10 Talents, 3 Influence for 25 Talents, or 7 Influence for 50 or more Talents.
A Senator may make one such contribution per Revenue Phase. Excess Contributions do not accumulate credit for Influence
gains in later turns.

After adding the Annual Revenue, Provincial Taxes and any contributions to the State Treasury,
subtract 20 Talents for each Active War (including Unprosecuted Wars and Civil Wars) and the costs for any Land Bills
in effect. Remove the Type I Land Bill marker after payment is made.

Finally, deduct 2 Talents for maintenance of each existing Legion or Fleet. Players cannot eliminate Forces
by voluntarily not paying maintenance, though the HRAO may decline to pay the maintenance for Forces released
by a Rebel this turn. Forces that cannot be maintained are eliminated. All the players should be advised when the
State Treasury drops below 50 or 20 Talents due to the danger of Bankruptcy to subsequent Event draws.

If unable to pay its obligations at any time in the game, the State is bankrupt
and the [Republic collapses](#1123-survival).

### 1.06.5 RETURNING GOVERNORS
At the end of the Revenue Phase move the center term dial of non-rebel Governors. When a term dial moves off of “1”
return the Governor to Rome and return the Province card to the Forum.

## 1.07 FORUM PHASE
### 1.07.1 PASSAGE OF TIME
Remove any Event cards in the Forum, unless the card specifically states otherwise.

### 1.07.2 INITIATIVE SEQUENCE
The [HRAO](#1091-how-the-senate-phase-works) player must roll 2d6 for Initiative. If he rolls a 7, he must roll 3d6
on the Random Events Table to determine which [Event card](#10721-events) he has drawn. Otherwise, he draws a card
from the Forum deck if it is not empty. He may then take any of the following steps in the order listed below:

- Make one [Persuasion Attempt](#1074-persuasion-attempts).
- Make one attempt to attract a [Knight](#1075-knights) or pressure his Knights.
- [Sponsor Games](#1076-sponsoring-games) once.

If the player rolls a 7 as his Initiative roll, he does not draw a card but instead must roll 3d6 on the
Random Events Table and place the corresponding light blue Event card from the table in play. If that Event card
is already in play, it is flipped to its dark blue side. If the Event card is already flipped to its dark blue side,
there are no additional effects unless otherwise specified on the Event card.

Once the HRAO has completed his Initiative Sequence, the other players in clockwise order complete an
Initiative Sequence until all players have completed one Initiative Sequence. Any additional Initiatives needed to bring
the total number for that turn to six are publicly auctioned off to the highest bidder
(once around clockwise, starting with the HRAO). Each Initiative is immediately completed by the winner of the bid.
This is repeated until there are no remaining Initiatives.

Only **Aligned Senators currently in Rome** may bid for an extra Initiative with the winning bid coming
from a single Personal Treasury. Winning the bid allows the entire Faction to take the Initiative Sequence.
If nobody bids for an Initiative, the HRAO’s Faction takes any Initiatives that are not bid on.

### 1.07.3 CARDS
There are two classes of cards: Cards with black text are called Forum cards and must be played face up in the Forum
when they are drawn. Cards with red text are called Faction cards and belong to the player who draws them.

#### 1.07.3.1 SENATORS
There are two types of Senator cards: Family cards, which are Forum cards, and Statesmen, which are Faction cards.
The number after the “MIL” on the right of the card is the Senator’s Military rating, representing his ability
as a Commander (general and admiral). The number after the “ORA” is the Oratory rating, representing his political
skills and voting power. The number after the “LOY” is his Loyalty rating, measuring the degree of allegiance
the Senator feels towards the Faction controlling him. The number in the bottom center of the card is his Influence
and serves as a fluctuating gauge of his prestige. This number is always positive;
a Senator can never have less than 0 Influence. The small number in the upper center of the card is the Senator
ID Number, which corresponds to a like-numbered Mortality Chit. Senator cards also contain designated areas to record
the Senator’s Popularity and Knight markers. If a Senator’s Popularity is negative, it is recorded with a black Number
marker. Popularity may not go above 9 or below -9.

Family cards are Senator cards with black text and a marble background that represent leading families in the Senate.
Having a particular Family card means a player has in his Faction the leading member of that family.
Should that Senator die, his place is taken by the next leading member of that family, who leaves the current Faction
and goes to the bottom of the Curia. Family cards with an ID# in brackets “[ ]” include a related prominent Statesman
that may appear during play.

Senator cards with an alpha-numeric ID, red text and a marble background represent outstanding individual Statesmen
with special capabilities. A player may not add his Statesman card to his Faction
if any of the following conditions exists:

- An opponent controls the related Family card; or
- A related Statesman with the same ID# is in play, except for [25A/B or 29A/B](#10522-gracchi--licinii-brothers)]

If the player already controls the related Family card, the Statesman is placed on top of it and takes over any current
possessions: all markers, Knights, and marked Influence and Popularity ratings greater than his own. Any printed ratings
of the Statesman that are less than that of the Family card remain equal to the Statesman’s printed rating.
If the related Family card is currently in the Forum, the Statesman is placed over it and both cards are moved to that
player’s Faction. If the matching Family card subsequently appears in the Forum, immediately place it beneath the
Statesman.

#### 1.07.3.2 CONCESSIONS
Concessions are Faction cards with a picture frame background that represent economic considerations such as collecting
taxes or distributing grain. The player who draws it from the deck owns a Concession.

If a Concession is destroyed (aka eliminated), then it is placed in the Concession space of the Curia.

#### 1.07.3.3 WARS
War cards are Forum cards with a parchment background representing external threats to Rome. The numbers next to the
icons on the right of the card represent its value in combat. The number next to the Swords icon is the enemy’s
Land Strength, which represents the value of his Army. The number next to the Anchor icon is the Fleet Support number,
which indicates the number of Roman Fleets, if any, required to support the War. Some War cards have a number
next to a Ship icon, which represents enemy Fleet Strength which must be defeated in a Naval Battle before conducting
the Land Battle. The numbers highlighted black and gray next to the D and S on the right of the card determine automatic
[Disasters](#1103-disasters) and [Standoffs](#1105-standoffs). The number inside the Coin on the bottom right
indicates the [Spoils of War](#1106-victory) that are generated upon defeat of the War. Some Wars have a Dying Plant
icon, which indicates the War causes a [Drought Effect](#1081-unrest). Some cards have an Armaments icon
beside the date, which indicates whether the War is Active or Inactive.

When a War card with is drawn:
- If there is a matching War in play, it goes to the ["Imminent Wars"](#1073321-imminent-wars) space
  and the matching War to the "Active Wars" space.
- If not and there is a matching Leader in the Curie, the Leader is attached to the War
  and the War goes to the "Active Wars" space.
- If not and the War has an Armaments icon, it goes to the "Active Wars" space.
- If not and the War has not Armaments icon, it goes to the "Inactive Wars" space.

Inactive Wars remain inactive in the Forum until the Senate sends an Army or Fleet to attack them,
or until activated by another card.

##### 1.07.3.4 MATCHING WARS AND REVOLTS
Whenever two or more Wars of the same type are active (e.g., two Punic Wars or two Cilician Pirates),
the Land and Fleet Strength (but not Fleet Support) of each are multiplied by the total number of matching Wars.
However, each War is fought individually - not added to its related Wars. When counting Active Wars,
each Matching War card is considered a single War. Rome may not attack the latter of any currently active Matching Wars
unless she first (or simultaneously) prosecutes all earlier (in Matching War Sequence) active Matching Wars.`
> EXAMPLE: Assume the 1st and 2nd Punic Wars are in the Forum. Rome need not defeat the 1st Punic War in order
> to attack the 2nd, but she must attack the 1st Punic War in the same turn she attacks the 2nd Punic War.

Each Matching War contains a line of text similar to “1st of 2 Cilician Pirates (1)”. The number in () is the number of
Wars of that type in the Era of the card (i.e. in the Early, Middle, or Late Republic deck).

Imminent Wars do not multiply any Active Wars until they become Active themselves. They can be attacked by the Senate
(just as if they were Inactive). The moment the Senate sends a Force to attack the Imminent War, it is instantly moved
to the Active War column and begins to multiply War Strengths.

> EXAMPLE: First Punic War begins the turn in an Inactive War slot. Third Punic War is drawn; it is placed in the
> Imminent War space, and the 1st Punic War is moved to an Active War space. The 2nd Punic War is drawn in the same
> turn; it is also placed in the Imminent War space. The Hannibal Leader card is then drawn; it is immediately placed
> with the active 1st Punic War. At the start of Turn 2, the 2nd Punic War is moved to an Active War space, but the
> 3rd Punic War remains Inactive until the start of Turn 3.

A Revolt is a type of War card in which no Spoils of War are created by defeating the War. Many Revolts are conditional
(i.e., they are treated as Revolts if a named Province currently exists at the time of being drawn, but are treated as
Wars that are not Revolts if it does not). Whenever the last War in a numbered series of Matching Wars is defeated,
any previous War in that series is thereafter treated as a Revolt.
> EXAMPLE: If the 3rd Punic War is defeated, the 1st and 2nd Punic Wars are considered Revolts.

#### 1.07.3.5 LEADERS
Leader cards are Forum cards with a parchment background representing the appearance of a particularly able enemy
Commander. Their presence makes a War more difficult to prosecute.

When a Leader card is drawn:
- If it matches a War in play, it rejoins the War. If not, it goes to the Curie.
- If the War was Inactive, it besomes Active. An Imminent War stays imminent.

While a Leader is active and matched with the War(s), the Land and Fleet Strength (not Fleet Support) number(s) of the
War(s) are increased by his value, after any relevant doubling, tripling, or quadrupling for Matching Wars.

The numbers on the right side of the Leader card determine automatic Roman [Disasters](#1103-disasters) and
[Standoffs](#1105-standoffs) directly attributable to the skill of the Leader and in addition to those in effect for
the War itself. Statesmen with “Nullifies Disaster / Standoff” abilities only void the D/S associated with the Wars,
not those of associated Leaders.

If the last active Matching War associated with a Leader is defeated, or a Leader is drawn when none of his
Matching Wars are currently in play, the Leader is moved to the Curia. If all of the Matching Wars associated with the
Leader are removed from the deck and board the Leader is removed from play. At the end of each Forum Phase,
an Aging roll on 1d6 must be made for each Leader in the Curia. If the result is a 5 or 6, that Leader dies and is
removed from play.

#### 1.07.3.6 INTRIGUE
Intrigue cards are Faction cards with a picture frame background that have various uses and requirements on when and how
they can be played.

#### 1.07.3.7 LAWS
Law cards are Faction cards on a scroll background that represent changes in the rules governing the Republic and play
of the Game. Display played Law cards in the Law space rather than mixing them with the discards. Law cards may be
played anytime during the [Senate Phase](#109-senate-phase) - even before the Consuls are elected.

#### 1.07.3.8 EVENTS
A few Event cards are Forum cards on a picture frame with parchment background. They are resolved immediately and in the
same manner as the blue-bordered Event deck. They are discarded after being fully resolved.

### 1.07.4 PERSUASION ATTEMPTS
A Senator in Rome may attempt to persuade an Unaligned Senator in the Forum or an already Aligned Senator also in Rome
to join his own Faction.

The Senator making the Persuasion Attempt adds his Oratory and Influence and subtracts from this sum the target
Senator’s Loyalty rating to get a Base Number. This Base Number can be modified by Loyalty, Bribes and Counter-Bribes.
The resulting Base Number is then compared to a 2d6 roll. If the roll is less than or equal to the Base Number,
the Persuasion Attempt succeeds and the target Senator joins the Faction of the Senator making the Persuasion Attempt.
If the original (unmodified) roll is greater than or equal to 10, or the modified roll is greater than the Base Number,
the Persuasion Attempt fails and the target Senator remains either Unaligned in the Forum or Aligned
to his current Faction.

If the target Senator is already Aligned, 7 is added to his Loyalty rating. The number of Talents in the
Personal Treasury of the target Senator, whether Aligned or not, is also added to his Loyalty rating.
Some Statesmen oppose others and display a “-“ followed by another Statesman’s name. If a Statesman belongs to the same
Faction as any Statesmen shown with a "-" on his card, his printed base Loyalty rating is reduced to 0; however,
he still adds 7 for being Aligned. Some Statesmen oppose others who do not oppose them back.
Other Statesmen have a “+” next to their names because both desire to belong to the same Faction.
In this case the Loyalty of 0 occurs when one brother belongs to a Faction an his brother to another.
This effect only occurs when both are in play.

The Senator making the Persuasion Attempt may spend money from his Personal Treasury to aid the Persuasion Attempt.
Each Talent spent adds 1 to the Base Number. This money is paid into the Personal Treasury of the target Senator
at the end of the Attempt, regardless of the outcome.

All players may interfere in a Persuasion Attempt made against a Senator by spending money from their Faction Treasuries
to resist (not aid) the Persuasion Attempt. Each Talent thus spent subtracts 1 from the Base Number.
This money is paid into the Personal Treasury of the target Senator at the end of the Attempt,
regardless of the outcome.

The Senator making the Persuasion Attempt announces his target and the initial Base Number, which may already reflect
money irrevocably spent from his Personal Treasury. Play then moves clockwise around the table, and each player in turn
announces the Talents, if any, he is irrevocably spending from his Faction Treasury to resist the Persuasion Attempt.
The player making the Persuasion Attempt may then either roll 2d6 at the present Base Number or irrevocably spend more
Talents, with bidding moving around the table again. This cycle of bidding continues until all players stop spending
money or the Persuader accepts the current Base Number. Money thus spent should be initially placed on the table in
front of a player’s Faction (making change as necessary) and transferred to the target Senator’s card only after the
Persuasion Attempt is resolved.

> EXAMPLE: Fabius wishes to make a Persuasion Attempt against Claudius, who is an Unaligned Senator in the Forum.
> Fabius adds his Oratory and Influence ratings and gets a sum of 7, from which he subtracts Claudius’ Loyalty rating
> of 7 to produce a Base Number of 0. Fabius spends 9 Talents from his Personal Treasury to bring the Base Number up
> to 9. Play then moves around the table, and the other players spend a total of 8 Talents from their collective Faction
> Treasuries to lower the Base Number to 1. Fabius responds by spending the 7 Talents remaining in his Personal Treasury
> to raise the Base Number to 8. Play revolves around the table again, but this time the other players are unwilling or
> unable to spend any more money, so the final Base Number is 8. Fabius rolls a 9, which is not less than or equal to 8,
> so the Persuasion Attempt fails and Claudius remains uncommitted. All the money spent on the Persuasion Attempt is
> placed in Claudius’ Personal Treasury, making him both more attractive and harder to get, since the 24 Talents now in
> his Personal Treasury are automatically added to his Loyalty rating in any future Persuasion Attempts.

### 1.07.5 KNIGHTS
A player may attempt to attract one Knight per Initiative to one of his Aligned Senators in Rome by paying 0 or more
Talents from that Senator’s Personal Treasury and then rolling a die. If the sum of the die roll and the number of
Talents paid is greater than or equal to 6, a Knight is attracted and that Senator places a Knight marker on his card
indicating the total number of Knights he controls. There is no limit to the number of Knights that may eventually be
controlled by a Senator. For each Knight a Senator controls he gains an extra vote in the Senate and an extra Talent of
income during the Revenue Phase.

Instead of rolling to attract a Knight, a player may opt to pressure any Knights he has in his Faction for contributions
and, in so doing, loses their support. He announces how many of his Knights under each of his Senators he will pressure
and rolls a die for each to determine the amount of Talents gained. This money must be added to each controlling
Senator’s respective Personal Treasury and the pressured Knights are discarded.

### 1.07.6 SPONSORING GAMES
Sponsoring Games allows a Senator to increase his Popularity while lowering the Unrest Level of the populace.
The Senator pays the cost of the games he wishes to Sponsor from his Personal Treasury (see the Games Table).
Adjust his Popularity and reduce the Unrest Level as indicated.

### 1.07.7 PUTTING ROME IN ORDER
After all six Initiatives have been resolved, the following steps are completed in order.

1. All Senators (in Rome or not) that currently hold a Major Office get a “Major” marker.
2. The HRAO then rolls a die for each Concession and Senator in the Curia. If he rolls a 5 or 6 that card is revived
   and placed face up in the Forum. He also rolls for each Leader in the Curia and discards it on a die roll of 5 or 6.

## 1.08 POPULATION PHASE
### 1.08.1 UNREST
The Unrest Level represents the degree of dissatisfaction of the populace with the government.
The Unrest Level starts at 0. There is no limit to how high the Unrest Level can go, but it can never go lower than 0.
To show an Unrest Level higher than 9, flip the Unrest Level marker over. At the beginning of the Population Phase,
the Unrest Level is adjusted for the following conditions:

- Each [Unprosecuted War](#1109-unprosecuted-wars) adds 1 to the Unrest Level.
- The Unrest Level is increased by 1 for each separate Drought Effect in play.
  Drought Effects can be caused by both Events and Wars, they are cumulative.
  Drought markers can be used to keep track of the number of Drought Effects in play.

> EXAMPLE: A War with a Drought Effect is in play and Unprosecuted. The Drought Event is rolled twice in the
> Forum Phase. The total modifier to the Unrest would be +4 (+1 for the Unprosecuted War and 3 for 3 Drought Effects -
> the initial Drought Effect on the War plus the 2 additional Drought Events rolled).

### 1.08.2 STATE OF THE REPUBLIC
The HRAO gives a State of the Republic speech by rolling 3d6, subtracting the Unrest Level, and adding his Popularity.
The result is found on the Population Table. The numbers on the Population Table indicate the amount the Unrest Level is
to be immediately increased or decreased.
- A result of “NR” (No Recruitment) places the No Recruitment marker onto the Force Pool.
- “MS” places the Manpower Shortage Event card into the Forum, places the Manpower Shortage marker onto the
  Force Pool and is cumulative with any existing [Manpower Shortage](#10721-events).
- “Mob” results in an assault on the Senate by an outraged mob, which is resolved by drawing six Mortality Chits
  to check among the [Senators currently in Rome](#1091-how-the-senate-phase-works) to determine the Senators killed.
- “People Revolt” results in an overthrow of the Senatorial government and its collapse.

## 1.09 SENATE PHASE
### 1.09.1 HOW THE SENATE PHASE WORKS
The Senate Phase is the heart of the Game. Players will put forward a variety of proposals which will then be voted on
by Senators and enacted if passed. The Senate is convened the moment the State of the Republic dice are thrown
in the Population Phase.
REMEMBER: Each player should readjust his Vote Tally dial as soon as he gains or loses votes for any reason.

All **Aligned Senators currently in Rome (ASCIR)**, and only them, attend the Senate.
This means every Senator except [Governors](#1095-governorships) in their Provinces,
[Proconsuls](#1108-proconsul) at War and [Rebel Senators](#1113-declaration-of-civil-war).

The HRAO is the Highest Ranking Available Official among ASCIR.
The order of precedence is listed on their Office Marker:

1. Dictator,
2. Rome Consul,
3. Field Consul,
4. Censor,
5. Master of Horse,
6. Pontifex Maximus.

If none of these officials is available due to death or absence from Rome, the ASCIR with the most Influence
opens the meeting (using Oratory ratings and then lowest ID# to break ties).
Note the Proconsul is a Major Office too, but never a HRAO as he is stripped from office on his return to Rome.

#### 1.09.1.2 PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
The HRAO is the Presiding Magistrate. He has complete control over the procedures of the Senate.
He may recognize Senators in any order he wishes and may call for the votes of each Faction in any order.
He alone makes nominations and proposals, and he may break off discussion on any proposal by calling for
an immediate vote. Any player who ignores his demand for an immediate vote is considered to have abstained.
After all elections (including Governors) and Prosecutions, he may close the meeting at any time there is no unresolved
proposal on the floor by saying “the Senate is adjourned.” If the Presiding Magistrate dies, the next HRAO
becomes Presiding Magistrate.

#### 1.09.1.3 PROPOSALS
A proposal is anything that is put before the Senate for a vote. A nomination is a type of proposal.
Whenever a vote is not in progress, any player may offer advice, discuss options, and/or suggest courses of action,
but only the Presiding Magistrate or a Tribune can formally define a proposal.
Only the Presiding Magistrate may call for votes.

Defeated proposals may not be introduced again in the same Senate Phase without significant change.
> EXAMPLES:
> - A proposal to assign Fabius 8 Legions fails. A subsequent proposal to assign Fabius 7 Legions or Claudius
>   8 Legions may be put forward.
> - A proposal to send Fabius to govern Hispania Citerior and Claudius to Sicilia might fail as a joint proposal
>   but a subsequent separate proposal to send Fabius to Hispania Citerior is legal.
> - A proposal to nominate Fabius and Claudius as Consuls fails. A Subsequent proposal to nominate Claudius and Fabius
>   as Consuls would be illegal (rewording the proposal is not enough).

A proposal is implemented as soon as the last Faction votes on it and the proposal passes. No cards can be played
or actions occur between the time the last Faction votes and the proposal is implemented.
> EXAMPLE: A Senator could not be Assassinated after he is elected Governor since he is considered to be in his
> Province as soon as the last vote on the passing proposal is cast.

#### 1.09.1.4 VOTING
After announcing the proposal, the Presiding Magistrate chooses a Faction to vote first. That Faction must vote
or abstain.. After that Faction votes or abstains, the Presiding Magistrate selects another Faction to vote,
and the process is repeated until all Factions have had an opportunity to vote or abstain.

Each Senator in Rome controls votes equal to his Oratory plus the number of Knights he controls. However, he may
temporarily increase his votes for any proposal by buying them. For each Talent he pays out of his Personal Treasury
he receives 1 extra vote for that round of voting. These Talents are paid out when the Senator’s votes are called upon.
All the Senators in a Faction need not vote alike. Once a Senator declares his vote, he may not change it.
A simple majority (> 50%) of votes cast is required to pass any measure.

Whenever the Presiding Magistrate makes a proposal which is defeated by unanimous vote of all other players, he may
choose to lose 1 Influence (down to a minimum of 0) or he may step down as Presiding Magistrate and immediately
hand over conduct of the meeting to the next HRAO. The Senator stepping down retains his office. This does not affect
the HRAO order, just who is the Presiding Magistrate.

### 1.09.2 CONSULS
The first act of any Presiding Magistrate must be to conduct elections for new Consuls from among the ASCIR. He must
nominate candidates in pairs. Any pair of candidates that is defeated may not be nominated again that turn as the
same pair, but the individuals making up the defeated pair may be nominated again as part of a new pair.
Candidates are elected or defeated as a pair. The current Consuls and Dictator (if any) may not be elected Consul
this turn. A Senator may not hold two offices simultaneously, but the current Censor or Master of Horse may be elected
Consul with the understanding that he will not continue to serve in his existing office.

Nominations continue until two Consuls are elected or until only one possible pair of candidates remains, in which case
this final pair is automatically appointed.

The newly elected Consuls decide amongst themselves who will be Rome Consul. If they cannot agree, they dice off for the
choice of office. Place the appropriate Consul markers on their respective cards and immediately increase their
Influence by 5. The new Rome Consul becomes Presiding Magistrate and takes over conduct of the meeting. The outgoing
Consuls receive Prior Consul markers if they don’t already have one.

If a Dictator and Master of the Horse exist, they lose their offices and the Dictator gains a Prior Consul marker.

### 1.09.3 DICTATOR
If Rome is facing 3 or more Active Wars, or one with a combined Land and Fleet Strength of at least 20, a Dictator may
be elected or appointed immediately after the Consular elections. A Naval Victory marker reduces the Naval Strength
of a War to 0 for this purpose. To be eligible for Dictator, a Senator must be Aligned, currently in Rome,
and not holding any office except Censor.

The Consuls, acting together, may appoint any eligible Senator on whom they can agree as Dictator.
If there is only one Consul present because the other is dead, he may act alone to appoint a Dictator.

If the Consuls cannot agree to appoint a Dictator, the Senate may immediately elect a Dictator if the
Presiding Magistrate calls for such elections. The Presiding Magistrate may continue to try to elect a Dictator
even after multiple failures; however, once a [Censor](#1094-censor) is elected,
a Dictator nomination may no longer be put forth.

The new Dictator becomes Presiding Magistrate, takes the Dictator marker, increases his Influence by 7,
and appoints as his Master of Horse any ASCIR not already holding an office (except Censor). That Senator takes
the Master of Horse marker and increases his Influence by 3. The Dictator’s proposals cannot be vetoed,
though all proposals must still be voted upon normally.

Whenever the Dictator commands a Force, he is accompanied by his Master of Horse. The Dictator’s Military rating
for any combat is the sum of his Military rating and that of his Master of Horse. The Master of Horse cannot be used
to nullify a [Disaster](#11021-disasters) or [Standoff](#11031-standoffs) result in any battle. The Master of Horse must
accompany the Dictator to War and cannot act independently of the Dictator.

### 1.09.4 CENSOR
Immediately after the election of the new Consuls and the option to appoint or elect a Dictator,
the Presiding Magistrate conducts elections for Censor. Eligible candidates for Censor must be an ASCIR with a
Prior Consul marker and must not hold an existing Major Office except for Censor. If only one eligible candidate of
Consular experience is available, he is appointed automatically. If there are no ASCIR with consular experience,
the election for Censor is temporarily thrown open to all Rome and any ASCIR can be nominated. Each time a Censor is
elected or appointed, the Censor marker is placed on that Senator’s card and his Influence increases by 5.
The Presiding Magistrate now turns the conduct of the meeting over to the Censor temporarily
for [Prosecutions](#10941-prosecutions).

#### 1.09.4.1 PROSECUTIONS
The Censor may conduct up to two Minor or one Major Prosecution each turn. During Prosecutions the Censor is
the Presiding Magistrate and conducts all voting. If he suffers a unanimous defeat, he may either
[lose the required Influence](#109144-loss-of-influence) or hand control of the meeting back to the previous
Presiding Magistrate and end all Prosecutions. A Censor may not Prosecute himself. Only the ASCIR may be Prosecuted.
If the Censor dies while the Prosecutions are ongoing, all unresolved Prosecutions fail and the meeting returns to
the Presiding Magistrate.

The Censor must appoint a consenting ASCIR to be Prosecutor for each Prosecution. The Prosecutor can not be the Censor
himself or the Accused. If no consenting Prosecutor can be found then there can be no Prosecution.

An ASCIR with a [Corrupt marker](#10613-provincial-spoils), a [Major marker](#1078-putting-rome-in-order), or a
Concession with a [revealed corrupt bar](#10612-knightsconcessions) is eligible for a Minor Prosecution.

To be eligible for a Major Prosecution the Accused must hold a [Major marker](#1078-putting-rome-in-order).

#### 1.09.4.2 TRIAL
The Censor calls for votes. Voting for the Prosecution is a vote for conviction. Voting against the Prosecution is a
vote against conviction. During a Prosecution the Accused receives additional votes equal to his Influence.

A Senator Accused in a Prosecution may appeal to the people when his Faction is called upon to vote. He rolls 2d6
and modifies it by his Popularity and finds the result on the Popular Appeal Table. All negative votes are added
to the votes “for” conviction; all positive votes gained are added to the votes “against” conviction. “Accused Killed”
means the populace is so disgusted by the self-serving rhetoric of the Accused that they kill him themselves.
If the Accused is killed in this way, the Accused is considered to have been guilty and the Prosecution
[successful](#10944-successful-prosecution). Conversely, a result of “Accused Freed” ends the Prosecution with
an acquittal and the Prosecution [fails](#10943-failed-prosecution). In addition, one Mortality Chit is drawn
for each number which exceeds 11 on the modified roll in order to see if either the Censor and/or the Prosecutor
(the only two vulnerable to the chit draw) is killed by a mob enraged over this obvious frame-up.

#### 1.09.4.3 FAILED PROSECUTION
If the Prosecution fails, the Accused goes free and may not be Prosecuted again this turn for the same reason.
Each Concession with a revealed corrupt bar is a different (separate) reason for Prosecution.

#### 1.09.4.4 SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION
If the Accused is convicted or dies as a result of the Prosecution, the Prosecutor gains the Prior Consul marker
of the Accused plus half (fractions rounded up) of any Influence lost by the Accused. Note that when a senator dies,
he loses ALL of his influence.

If convicted in a Minor Prosecution, the Accused loses 5 Popularity (to a minimum of -9), 5 Influence
(to a minimum of 0), any Prior Consul marker and must return all of his Concessions to the Forum.

If convicted in a Major Prosecution, the Accused is [executed](#1053-death-consequences).

#### 1.09.4.5 END OF PROSECUTIONS
Upon completion of his Prosecutions, the Censor turns the meeting back to the normal Presiding Magistrate,
and all Corrupt and Major markers are removed from the ASCIR. All Concessions are reajusted to hide the corrupt bar.

### 1.09.5 GOVERNORSHIPS
When a Province is created, place its card in the Forum yellow side up. Each Province in the Forum has a Governorship
that the Senate must fill from among its membership during the Senate Phase. Elections for all open Governorships are
conducted immediately after Prosecutions and before conducting other business. Elections continue until a Governor
is selected or there is only one eligible candidate remaining. When a Governor is elected, the Province card is placed
with his Senator card, and he must leave Rome immediately without participating in any remaining Senate votes.
Elections for multiple Governorships, including [recalls](#10952-recall), may be held simultaneously so that Governors
will be elected (or rejected) in tandem and depart at the same time, but no other proposal may be added to
the same vote. The holder of a Major Office may not be proposed as a Governor.

All Governorships are for a period of up to 3 turns. Adjust the term dial on the Province to “3” and reduce it by one
at the end of each Revenue Phase unless its Governor is in Revolt. When the dial moves off of “1”, the Governor
returns to Rome. He may not be re-elected to that or another Governorship without his consent during the turn of
his return unless there are no other eligible candidates in Rome. Likewise, a newly [recalled Governor](#10952-recall)
may not be sent out again on the same turn he was recalled without his consent unless there are no other
eligible candidates in Rome.

A Governor may be recalled immediately by electing a new Governor, provided the recalled Governor was not elected
this same turn. The replacement Governor inherits the Province with the term dial reset for 3 turns.

All Provinces must have a Governor at the end of the Senate Phase unless there are no eligible candidates available.
If a Governor dies during the Senate Phase after all vacant Governorships have been assigned, another Governor must be
elected at the earliest opportunity. A Province without a Governor does not generate or lose money for the State,
nor can it be Developed.

### 1.09.6 OTHER BUSINESS
The Presiding Magistrate may now conduct other business by proposing whatever motions he wishes. Proposals of the same
type may be grouped together but each proposal may consist of only one kind of proposal at a time. For example,
a proposal could not group a Land Bill with a Concession vote to increase the chances of passage.

The Presiding Magistrate may close the meeting whenever he chooses, as long as there is no unresolved motion
on the floor. He simply states “the Senate is adjourned”.

#### 1.09.6.1 ASSIGN CONCESSIONS
Proposals may be made to assign a specific Concession from the Forum to an ASCIR. Group proposals may be made to
simultaneously assign different Concessions to different Senators to increase voting support. If a proposal to assign
a Concession fails, that Concession card is flipped over to indicate that it may not be proposed again during
the same Game Turn. There is no limit to the number of Concessions a Senator may control.

#### 1.09.6.2 LAND BILLS
The Senate can improve the Unrest Level by passing Land Bills. Three kinds are available; Type I is a one-turn,
single payment measure costing 20 Talents, while Types II and III are permanent measures requiring payments of 5 and 10
Talents every turn, but lowering the Unrest Level only during the turn of their passage. The Senate may propose no more
than one Land Bill of each Type per turn. The number of Land Bills that may be in effect at one time is limited by
the number of such markers available.

A Land Bill proposal must name two consenting Senators as Sponsor and Co-Sponsor. If the Land Bill passes, lower
the Unrest Level and raise the Popularity of the Sponsor and Co-Sponsor as indicated on the Land Bills Table.
Place the appropriate Land Bill marker in the applicable box of the State Revenue. Every Senator who votes against
a Land Bill lowers his Popularity as indicated on the Land Bills Table. Popularity changes for Sponsoring,
Co-Sponsoring, and Voting are cumulative. Abstaining is not allowed during the passage or repeal of a Land Bill;
any player refusing to vote on a Land Bill when prompted is considered to have voted against it (or for its repeal).
Propositions Land Bills and their repeal can never be grouped — each Land Bill must be proposed as a separated motion.

The Senate may attempt to repeal a Type II or III Land Bill, even on the same turn it passed. A Senator must volunteer
to Sponsor the repeal, and this Senator must have Popularity equal to or greater than the amount he will lose
by sponsoring and voting for the repeal. The Sponsor lowers his Popularity as indicated on the Land Bills Table
and must vote for that repeal. Popularity losses for Sponsoring and Voting are cumulative. If the repeal passes,
raise the Unrest Level as indicated on the Land Bills Table. Senators who vote for the repeal lower their Popularity
accordingly. Only one Land Bill repeal may be attempted per turn.

#### 1.09.6.3 RECRUITMENT OF FORCES
The Senate may vote to raise or eliminate Forces. The maximum number of Legions and Fleets the Republic may have
as Active Forces is 25 of each. A Legion or Fleet cannot be both eliminated and built (or rebuilt) in the same
Senate Phase. The number to be raised must be specified in the original proposal. Forces raised are taken from the
Force Pool and placed in the Active Forces boxes. The State Treasury must immediately pay 10 Talents for each
new unit raised. The Senate may only vote to eliminate units located in the Active Forces boxes.

Any Senator who holds the Armaments or Ship Building Concessions **must** immediately collect the income listed
on the Concession when Legions or Fleets are built. Senators taking money in this way reveal the Concession’s
corrupt bar.

#### 1.09.6.4 DEPLOYMENT OF FORCES
The Senate may send a Commander and a specific group of Forces in the Active Forces boxes to attack any available
Active, Inactive, or Imminent War. The Senate may not send a Force to fight a War unless it is supported by the number
of Fleets required by that War. [Multiple Forces](#109645-multiple-forces) may be sent against the same War.

Only the Field Consul, the Rome Consul and the Dictator (with the Master of Horse) can be sent to War.
The Field Consul must be sent to War before (or in conjunction with) the Rome Consul, but there is no such limitation
as to the sequence in which the Dictator can be sent to War. These proposals may be made separately or in a package.
When a measure to send a Force to attack passes, those units are placed on the Commander’s card, and he is immediately
absent from Rome and placed overlapping the War. Forces already on the War without a Commander join his Force.

Passing any measure sending the Presiding Magistrate to War ends the Senate Phase.

The Senate may not propose to send a Commander to fight a War without his consent unless the combined Strength of
his Force (including his Military rating) is at least equal to that of the War and any applicable Leader.
If as a result of losses sustained in a previous turn, a Proconsul’s Force falls beneath that of the opposing War,
he has no right of refusal and must attack again the following turn.

##### 1.09.6.4.1 RECALL
The Senate may vote to recall or replace any [Proconsul](#1108-proconsul). He returns to Rome immediately and his Force
is placed in the Active Forces boxes unless a replacement Commander is sent to take his place as part of the recall.
The Senate may also recall part of a Force to the Active Forces boxes, leaving the rest with its Commander in the field.
The Senate may not recall Legions from a Proconsul without his consent that will reduce the Strength of his Force to
less than that of his War and any applicable Leaders. The Senate may also recall all or part of a Force without
a Commander. The Senate may neither recall a Commander (or his Force) who was deployed during the current Senate Phase
nor a Commander (or his Force) if he has already been reinforced in the current Senate Phase.

##### 1.09.6.4.2 MULTIPLE FORCES
The Senate may send more than one Force under different Commanders to fight the same War. However, if they do so,
each Force must attack separately, one at a time, until the War is defeated or all Forces have attacked.

> EXAMPLE: A natural roll of 14 would result in a Disaster for the first battle resolution of the Jugurthine War, but a subsequent natural roll of 14 for a different Force against the same War on the same turn would not be considered a Disaster.

##### 1.09.6.4.3 BASE PROVINCE STRENGTH AND GARRISONS
Each Province has a Base Land and Naval Strength depending on whether the Province is Developed or not.
These Base Province Strengths are defenses innate to the Provinces and can be enhanced by Garrisons.
The Senate may vote to send one or more Legions to a Province to augment its Base Land Strength. Once sent, they remain
there until recalled and follow the Province to the Forum when it is up for reassignment. Garrisons cannot be recalled
in the same turn they are deployed. Garrisons are under command of the current Governor. The only thing that
Garrisoned Legions do is protect the Province and Governor from dangerous Events.

Provinces with underscored names and black-bordered silhouettes are Frontier Provinces, which are susceptible
to the Barbarian Raids and should be Garrisoned accordingly.

##### 1.09.6.4.4 REINFORCEMENTS
The Senate may send additional Forces to a Commander during the Senate Phase. If a Proconsul has no Legions left
or insufficient Fleets to prosecute the War, he must be reinforced or he will be automatically recalled at the end
of the current Senate Phase. A Commander that left Rome in the current Senate Phase may not be reinforced.

### 1.09.7 ASSASSINS
Players may attempt to eliminate opposing Senators by announcing an Assassination attempt which will be carried out
by a specific Senator belonging to the player attempting the Assassination. Possession of an Assassin card is
not necessary to attempt an Assassination. Non-targeted Factions may not interfere with this attempt with
their own cards. No Faction may be the target of more than one attempt per turn, and no Faction may attempt more
than one Assassination per turn. A Faction may not attempt to Assassinate one of its own Senators.

Assassinations may be attempted only while the Senate is in session (i.e. they can not be announced any more
once the HRAO states "The Senate is Adjourned") and only by and against the ASCIR. No other card besides "Assassin"
may be played between when the Assassination is called and when the 1d6 roll is made.

#### 1.09.71 RESOLUTION
The Assassin announces the Senator making the attempt and his target before rolling 1d6.
Results are found on the Assassination Table.

If the Presiding Magistrate dies, the vote continues with the next HRAO acting as Presiding Magistrate.
A nominee up for an office who is Assassinated immediately cancels the current proposal and a new nominee
(or set of nominees) must be provided by the Presiding Magistrate,
except for [Concession Assignments](#10961-assign-concessions)
and [Consul for Life nominations](#109821-consul-for-life-election), which can only be proposed once a turn.
If the Prosecutor dies, the Prosecution is cancelled but still counts towards the Censor’s limit.
If the Censor dies during Prosecutions, the current Prosecution is cancelled and no more Prosecutions are possible.
A Senator’s vote is counted even if he is dead by the end of the vote, as long as he voted before he died.
A Land Bill vote is never cancelled by the death of a Senator, whether he is Sponsor or Co-Sponsor.

#### 1.09.72 BODYGUARDS
If the target Senator has one or more “Secret Bodyguard” cards, he may announce after the roll how many of those cards
he will play to defend against the Assassination attempt. Each Bodyguard so used subtracts 1 from the roll
and is discarded after use. The "Open Bodyguard" card must be in play prior to an Assassination attempt to have
any effect. If the Assassin is not caught, for each Bodyguard card played, the Assassin must roll again with
all applicable modifiers solely to determine if he is caught. It is therefore possible for the first roll to kill
the victim and a subsequent roll to result in the Assassin’s capture.

#### 1.09.73 PUNISHMENT
A caught Assassin is killed. In addition, the Senator with the most influence his Faction loses 5 Influence and,
if he is in Rome, is the subject of an immediate Special Major Prosecution, in which he **must** make
a [Popular Appeal](#109421-popular-appeal). However, instead of modifying the Popular Appeal roll by his own Popularity,
he must subtract the Popularity of the target Senator. So, if the target had negative Popularity, add it to the roll.
The Censor is Presiding Magistrate for a Special Major Prosecution, even if he is the Accused Senator.
If there is no Censor, the HRAO runs the vote. A Prosecutor is not selected for this Special Major Prosecution
and this special Prosecution does not count against the Censor Prosecution limit. Influence of the Accused is counted
as normal. A Special Major Prosecution only temporarily suspends the current proposal; the proposal continues after
the Prosecution is resolved, if possible. If the Accused Senator is found guilty he is killed.
In addition to his own death, a number of Mortality Chits equal to the target’s Popularity (if positive) are drawn,
and other members of the Assassin’s Faction currently in Rome whose chits are drawn are also implicated and killed.

### 1.09.8 MISC SENATE RULES
The following proposals and rules apply alongside the routine procedures of the Senate Phase.

#### 1.09.8.1 REPOPULATING ROME
Whenever the number of ASCIR falls below 8 during a Senate Phase due to death or absence, the top Senator card
in the Curia is promoted to active status in the Faction of the player with the fewest total Senators. Ties are resolved
in favor of the player with the least total Influence currently in Rome, with further ties being broken by a dice roll.
Such promotions continue until the number of active Senators in Rome reaches 8 or the Curia is empty. If the Curia has
no Senators, those in the Forum can be substituted and the choice of which of the available Senators to take is up to
the receiving player. If no further Senators are currently available in either the Curia or the Forum,
no such promotion occurs.

#### 1.09.8.2 CONSUL FOR LIFE
If a Consul for Life is elected or appointed, that player gains control of all non-Rebel Factions and will win the Game
should the Republic [survive](#1123-survival) the current Game Turn, unless a Rebel achieves one of his own
[Victory Conditions](#1121-winning) in the same turn. The Consul For Life cannot be assassinated, not even by a Senator
belonging to the Rebel Faction.

##### 1.09.8.2.1 CONSUL FOR LIFE (ELECTION)
During the Senate Phase following the Consular elections, but not during Prosecutions, the HRAO may nominate any ASCIR
with at least 21 Influence “Consul for Life”. The nominee may already hold an office. For this vote, the nominee may add
his Influence to his vote total. Consul for Life can be proposed only once per turn and cannot be vetoed.
Assassination attempts may take place during such a vote, until the Consul for Life is actually elected.

##### 1.09.8.2.2 CONSUL FOR LIFE (APPOINTMENT)
If at any time in the Game an ASCIR and has 35 Influence he immediately becomes the Consul for Life. If two or more
Senators qualify in the same turn, the one exceeding 35 by the most is the Consul for Life. If equal, the Senator
belonging to the Faction with the most combined Influence is Consul for Life. Achieving Consul for Life in this manner
is an automatic appointment – there is no chance for an Assassination attempt. In the event that Senators are both
elected and appointed Consul for Life in the same turn, the elected one ceases to be Consul for Life.

##### 1.09.8.2.3 CONSUL FOR LIFE (END GAME)
If a Senator has “won” by being elected or appointed Consul for Life, he takes over all non-rebel Factions
and plays them as if they were his own and makes all decisions on their behalf, unless he dies. He is not the HRAO
or the Presiding Magistrate. He may look at a non-rebel player’s hand at any time, but may not play any of the other
player’s cards. He may not force other Factions to make Assassination attempt or to vote against a Land Bill.
He may not become a [Rebel](#1113-declaration-of-civil-war), even a [secondary](#11132-secondary-rebels) one,
although he may be in the Rebel Faction. Only the Faction with the Primary Rebel may vote normally and conduct
Assassination attempts (although not on the Consul for Life himself). Note that players will regain control
of their Factions if the Consul for Life dies.

### 1.09.9 AUTOMATIC RECALLS
Once the Senate is closed, all Proconsuls who have insufficient Fleet Support, no Legions when fighting a Land Battle,
or no Fleets when fighting a Naval Battle are automatically recalled. Any Force without a Commander
is also automatically recalled at this time.

## 1.10 COMBAT PHASE
### 1.10.1 WAR
Any Wars to which the Senate has sent a Force are now fought. Wars are resolved one at a time,
Rome is always the attacker. Wars are resolved in the order in which the Senate dispatched the Commanders during
the Senate Phase. If a single proposal resulted in the deployment of multiple Armies against the same War
and they cannot agree in what order to attack, randomly dice off to determine the order.

#### 1.10.1.1 LAND BATTLES
Land Battles may only be fought if enough Fleets are present to meet or exceed the Fleet Support of the War.
In Land battles the Commander adds his Military rating to the Strength of his Army. Army Strength equals the number
of Legions in the Army, with [Veteran Legions](#1105-veterans) counting double. From this he subtracts the Land Strength
number of the War (the number next to the Swords icon), which may be modified by the presence of
a [Matching War](#107332-matching-wars) or [Leader](#107342-leader-strength). To this number is added 3d6,
and the result is located on the Combat Results Table to determine the outcome (see also [Disasters](#11021-disasters)
and [Standoffs](#11031-standoffs)).

#### 1.10.1.2 NAVAL BATTLES
Those Wars that show a Fleet Strength (i.e. a number next to the Ship icon) require two separate battles,
one Naval Battle and one Land Battle. The enemy Fleet Strength must be defeated before his land Forces may be attacked.
A Naval Battle is the same as Land Battle except that the number of Fleets, rather than Legions, is counted.
War cards whose Fleet has been defeated are marked with a Naval Victory marker. Once the enemy Fleet is defeated,
any Legions still present may (at the discretion of the Commander) immediately proceed to
a [Land Battle](#11011-land-battles) in the same Combat Phase, provided there are still sufficient Fleets to support
the Army and the Commander was not [killed](#1107-commander-death). If Rome has sent a Fleet with no Legions,
the Commander and his Force return to Rome immediately if victorious. Once won, the Naval Battle need not be re-fought
in subsequent turns and the War can be won by defeating only the enemy Land Strength.

### 1.10.2 DEFEATS
A result of “Defeat” means the Roman Commander and his Master of Horse (if present) are killed and loses the Forces
indicated on the Combat Results Table (they are returned to the Force Pool). Surviving Forces remain on the War card.
The Unrest Level is immediately increased by 2.

### 1.10.3 DISASTERS
Each War and Leader has a black Disaster number following a "D" on the right side of the card. If this number is rolled
prior to any modification while resolving combat, the Combat Results Table is ignored, and the Battle is an automatic
“Disaster”, causing loss of half (rounded up) of all participating Roman forces. Fleet and Legion losses are each halved
and rounded up separately. The Unrest Level is increased by 1. The Roman Commander remains in command as Proconsul.
Each Disaster number can only be applied once per turn per War, so subsequent Forces (if any) fighting the War can not
suffer the same Disaster in the same turn.

### 1.10.4 STALEMATES
A result of “Stalemate” means the War is undecided. The Roman Force loses the Forces indicated on the
Combat Results Table. Surviving Forces remain on the War card. The Roman Commander remains in command as Proconsul.

### 1.10.5 STANDOFFS
Each War and Leader has one or two gray Standoff numbers following an “S” on the right side of the card.
If these numbers are rolled prior to any modification while resolving combat, the Combat Results Table is ignored,
and the Battle is an automatic Standoff, causing loss of one quarter (rounded up) of all Forces.
Fleet and Legion losses are quartered and rounded separately. The Roman Commander remains in command as Proconsul.
Each Standoff number can only be applied once per turn per War, so subsequent Forces (if any) fighting the War
can not suffer the same Standoff in the same turn.

### 1.10.6 VICTORY
A Land “Victory” lowers the Unrest Level by 1 and eliminates the War. A Naval “Victory” also lowers the Unrest Level
by 1 and results in a Naval Victory marker being placed on the War. The Roman Force loses the Forces indicated on the
Combat Results Table and the surviving Forces remain on the Commander’s card,
provided the Commander [survives](#1107-commander-death). In some cases one or more Provinces will be created
and placed in the Forum. The victorious Commander increases both his Popularity and Influence by half (rounded up)
of the unmodified (printed) Land or Fleet War Strength number. Whan the Land battle is won and the War eliminated,
Players increase the State Treasury for Spoils of War by an amount equal to the number inside the Coin on the
bottom right of the card. Revolts do not yield Spoils of War.

> EXAMPLE: Marius is dispatched with 9 Legions to deal with the Gladiator Revolt that is matched with
> the Leader Spartacus. Marius’ Military rating of 4 is added to the number of his 9 Legions, for a total Strengt
> of 13. If Marius had only 3 Legions, he could only add 3 from his Military rating (1.10.11). The Land Strength on the
> Gladiator Revolt card is 6, which is increased to 11 because the appropriate Leader card, Spartacus, happens to be
> in play. 13 minus 11 is 2. The player controlling Marius then rolls 3d6, rolling a 10, which is added to the base of
> 2 for a final result of 12. A 12 on the Combat Results Table is a “Stalemate” with a loss of 1 Legion and 1 Fleet.
> Marius loses 1 Legion (he has no Fleets), and must draw 1 Mortality Chit to check for his own death (1.10.7).
> Had he had a Fleet to lose, he would have had to draw 2 Mortality Chits. The Gladiator Revolt may be fought again
> during the next Combat Phase. Had the Combat roll been 11 or 6, the result would have been a “Disaster” with the loss
> of 5 Legions. Had the Combat roll been a 14 or 16, the result would have been a “Standoff” with the loss of 3 Legions.

### 1.10.7 VETERANS
One Legion from among the survivors of a Land Battle that is a Stalemate, Standoff, or Victory is transformed
into a Veteran Legion by flipping it to its Veteran side. Veterans are not created in Naval Battles.
The corresponding Legion Allegiance marker is placed on the Commander’s card until he dies or the Legion is eliminated.
The Legion will remain a Veteran Legion until eliminated.

### 1.10.8 TAKING LOSSES
Units that are removed are always chosen at random. When both Veteran and normal Legions are involved,
the units eliminated are drawn at random from among those present. The Commander, regardless of the Battle result,
immediately loses 1 Popularity for every 2 Legions that are lost (round down). Commanders never lose Popularity
for losing Fleets.

### 1.10.9 COMMANDER DEATH
In any battle other than Defeat, draw a number of [Mortality Chits](#10521-mortality-resolution) equal to the number
of units lost. If a number belonging to the present Commander or Master of Horse is drawn,
that Senator is [killed](#1053-death-consequences). Mortality Chits belonging to other Senators have no effect.
If the Master of Horse has been killed, the Dictator may not appoint another unless he is reelected or reappointed
as Dictator. If the Dictator is killed and the Master of Horse survives, the Master of Horse immediately returns
to Rome and relinquishes his office.

### 1.10.10 PROCONSUL
A Commander who survives a non-victorious battle, or who gains a Naval Victory but not a Land Victory and has at least
one surviving Legion in his Force, becomes a Proconsul and remains in command of the Force and away from Rome.
A new Proconsul immediately receives a Prior Consul marker. A Commander may remain Proconsul as long as he retains
his command against the War he was originally sent to fight. If a Dictator is made Proconsul, his Master of Horse
must return to Rome. There is no limit to the number of Proconsuls that can exist. A Proconsul is not a Consul.
Proconsul is a Major Office.

### 1.10.11 UNPROSECUTED WARS
An Active War is considered “Prosecuted” if at least one of the following requirements is met:

- A Land Battle was fought against the Active War this turn and the Active War ended the Combat Phase
  with at least one Legion and the required minimum Fleet Support; or
- A Naval Battle was fought against the Active War this turn and the Active War ended the Combat Phase
  with at least one Fleet and/or a Naval Victory marker.

If neither of these requirements is met, the Active War is moved to an “Unprosecuted War” space of the Forum
at the end of the Combat Phase.

## 1.11 REVOLUTION PHASE
### 1.11.1 PLAY STATESMEN/CONCESSIONS
First, all players may trade (or give away) [Faction cards](#1045-trading-cards). Then, starting with the HRAO
and proceeding clockwise, each player may play any of his or her [Statesmen](#107312-statesmen-senators) and/or
[Concessions](#10732-concessions). Statesmen and Concessions can be played in the same phase in which they are received
in trade. Statesmen and Concessions can be played even if the target Senator is not in Rome.

### 1.11.2 EXCESS FACTION CARDS
Next, each player must discard Faction cards until there are no more than five in his or her hand.

### 1.11.3 DECLARATION OF CIVIL WAR
Victorious Forces without a Commander return now to the Active Forces boxes. Starting with the HRAO and proceeding
clockwise, each Commander who gained a Land Victory in this turn (including a Senate Victory) must either lay down
his command (i.e. return his Force to the Active Forces boxes and return to Rome) or declare himself in Revolt.

Only one Faction may be in Revolt at a time. Since the Master of Horse does not have an independent command,
he can only be declared in Revolt [in conjunction with the Dictator](#11132-secondary-rebels). Should a Faction
that wishes to Revolt field a stronger Force (including the Commander’s Military rating) than that of a previously
declared Rebel, the initial Rebel’s declaration is ignored, and the player with the stronger Force is considered
in Revolt instead. Once a Primary Rebel has been determined, no other player may Revolt in subsequent turns until
that Rebel has been [killed](#111371-senate-victory). The Rebel is now “Marching on Rome.” The Army of the Primary Rebel
is an Active War until the Rebel is killed or achieves one of his [Victory Conditions](#1121-winning), it is treated
as a normal War for all purposes (Unrest, Losing conditions, Prosecution conditions ...).

#### 1.11.3.1 COMMANDER ALLEGIANCE
Before announcing his decision, a Commander considering Revolt may roll 1d6 for each Legion in his current command
(unless they are Veteran and belong to the Commander) to determine if it will follow him. A result ≥5 is required
for a Legion to follow the Rebel Senator during the Early Republic. The number is lowered to ≥4 in the Middle Republic,
and to ≥3 in the Late Republic. Before making the first die roll, he may irrevocably spend money from his
Personal Treasury (or the Personal Treasury of his Master of Horse with his consent) to buy modifications to those
die rolls. For each Talent spent, the Rebel Commander may add 1 to the die roll of one Legion. Only one Talent
may be spent on each Legion. Veteran Legions owing their allegiance to a Rebel Commander follow their Commander
automatically. Veteran Legions owing their allegiance to a non-Rebel Senator must still roll a die and do not
automatically follow the Rebel. Legions that do not follow the Rebel Senator return to the Active Forces boxes.
Fleets play no role in a Civil War and any Fleet that started with the Rebel Commander immediately return
to the Active Forces boxes upon declaration.

#### 1.11.3.2 SECONDARY REBELS
When a Senator Revolts, each other Senator in his Faction must immediately declare his loyalty to the State
or join him in Revolt. Those who remain loyal to the State may continue to function and collect Revenue normally.
Those who join the Revolt leave Rome and lose all Offices, except Governorships. The Primary Rebel can use any money
in the Secondary Rebels’ Personal Treasuries as if it were his own. Governors that join the Revolt keep their Provinces,
but Garrisons of Rebel Governors are not available to (and do not require maintenance from) the Primary Rebel
or the Senate. Veteran Legions owing allegiance to the Primary Rebel or a Secondary Rebel follow the Primary Rebel
in Revolt without maintenance and join him upon declaration. Secondary Rebels with independent commands may not
contribute other Forces to the Rebel at this time and must return their non-Garrison Legions and Fleets
to Senate control. In the case of the Master of Horse with a Rebel Dictator, the Master of Horse may become
a Secondary Rebel only if he is in the same Faction as the Dictator.

#### 1.11.3.3 MAINTENANCE
Rebel Legions & Fleets cost 2 Talents per turn to maintain and must be paid before
the [Redistribution of wealth](#1063-redistribution) occurs. The Rebel Senator can pay this from his Personal
or Faction Treasury. Veteran Legions owing allegiance to a Rebel Senator and Garrisons of Rebel Governor require
no maintenance, while Veteran Legions owing no allegiance must be maintained normally. If the Rebel cannot pay
the required maintenance during the Revenue Phase, he must release the Legions and Fleets he cannot afford.
Any Legions or Fleets that are released in this manner immediately return to the Senate.

#### 1.11.3.4 INCOME
A Senator in Revolt returns his Concessions to the Forum, loses all of his Knights, and forfeits
all [Personal Revenue](#1061-personal-revenue). A Senator in Revolt may not receive money directly
from any Faction Treasury or any loyal Senator’s Personal Treasury.

#### 1.11.3.5 COMBAT REQUIREMENT
During each Combat Phase in which there is a Rebel Marching on Rome, the Primary Rebel must fight the Army deployed
by the Senate. If the Senate [fails to deploy an Army](#10964-deployment-of-forces) against him, his coup is successful
and he wins the Game, provided the Republic [survives](#1123-survival).

#### 1.11.3.6 VETERAN LEGION ALLEGIANCE
If there are Veteran Legions of a loyal Senator in a Rebel Army or a Rebel Garrison, the loyal Senator may instruct
his Veteran Legions to desert to a Senate Army sent to fight the Rebel Army, or to the Active Forces boxes,
at any time after [the Primary Rebel has been determined](#1113-declaration-of-civil-war).

#### 1.11.3.7 COMBAT RESOLUTION
The Senate is the attacker and the rebel the defender. The [normal combat procedure](#11011-land-battles) is followed.
The Strength number of the defender is the sum of the Strength of the Legions in his Army and the Military rating
of the Primary Rebel Senator. If both the Master of Horse and the Dictator
[were declared Rebels](#1113-declaration-of-civil-war) the ex-Master of Horse (Secondary Rebel) may add
his Military Rating to the ex-Dictator’s (Primary Rebel) Military Rating. Any combat losses called for by
the Combat Results Table are applied to both armies, except if the result is ALL then the Rebel Force takes no losses
while the Senate Force loses all of its units. Mortality Chits drawn for losses can affect either Commander,
and any Master of Horse and Rebel ex-Master of Horse.

##### 1.11.3.7.1 SENATE VICTORY
A result of “Victory” means the Revolt has failed, all Rebel Senators are killed and all surviving Rebel Legions
and Fleets are returned to the Active Forces boxes. Lower the Unrest Level by 1. The Commander of the Senate’s Army
increases both his Popularity and Influence by an amount equal to half of the Strength number of the defender
he defeated (rounded up).

##### 1.11.3.7.2 CIVIL WAR STALEMATE
“Stalemate” means the Revolt is undecided, and must be continued during the next Combat Phase. If all the Senate Armies
are destroyed through combat losses, the Rebel does not automatically win and the Senate will have a chance to attack
him again next turn.

##### 1.11.3.7.3 SENATE DEFEAT
“Defeat”, unless the Primary Rebel [dies in this battle](#1107-commander-death), means the Revolt has succeeded and
the Rebel now rules Rome and wins the Game. All surviving Senate Armies are returned to the Active Forces boxes and
the Rebel Force suffers no losses.

#### 1.11.3.8 REVOLT FAILURE
The Revolt fails if all Legions of the Primary Rebel are destroyed or if the Primary Rebel is killed. This does only
count as a Victory (for Popularity, Influence, and ability to declare himself in Revolt) for the Senate Commander if
the losses were a result of achieving a “Victory” on the Combat Results Table.

When a Revolt fails, all Secondary Rebels are killed and any surviving Rebel Forces are returned to Senate control
(i.e. place them in the Active Forces boxes).

## 1.12 VICTORY CONDITIONS
### 1.12.1 WINNING
The Game ends when a Faction fulfils any of the following Victory Conditions, listed in trump order.
In all cases except number 5, Rome must [survive](#1123-survival) until the end of the turn.

1. A Rebel Senator, while Marching on Rome, wins if the Senate fails to attack his Army in
   a [Combat Phase](#11135-combat-requirement) or if he [defeats the Senate in battle](#111373-senate-defeat)
   without [dying in that battle](#1107-commander-death).
2. A Rebel Senator wins if the State goes [Bankrupt](#10653-debits) or the [People Revolt](#1082-state-of-the-republic).
3. A Senator wins when he is appointed [Consul for Life](#109822-consul-for-life-appointment).
4. A Senator wins when he is elected [Consul for Life](#109821-consul-for-life-election).
5. At the end of the Forum Phase in which the Era Ends card is revealed, the Faction with the most combined Influence
   from non-Rebel Senators wins, unless other victory or defeat conditions intervene. If combined Faction Influence is
   tied, break the tie in favor of the non-Rebel Senator with the highest individual Influence in the tied Factions.
   If still tied, the tied Faction with the highest current [total of votes](#109141-votes) (not counting Talents) wins.

### 1.12.2 LOSING
The Game ends in defeat for all players if one of the following conditions occurs:
1. There are 4 or more Active Wars in play at the end of a Combat Phase. A Civil War is an Active War unless a Rebel
   has met one of his [Victory Conditions](#1121-winning).
2. A result of “People Revolt” is obtained during a [Population Phase](#1082-state-of-the-republic)
   with no Rebel Senator in play.
3. The State Treasury goes [Bankrupt](#10653-debits) (unable to pay for anything when required)
   with no Rebel Senator in play.

### 1.12.3 SURVIVAL
Unless a player wins through [the draw of the Era Ends card](#1121-winning), his victory is not secured until the end
of the current Game Turn, at which time Rome must still exist. If Rome is beset by 4 or more Active Wars at the end
of any Combat Phase, all players lose. A Civil War counts as an Active War unless a Rebel has achieved one
of his [Victory Conditions](#1121-winning).

If a Rebel achieves one of his [Victory Conditions](#1121-winning), but there are still 4 or more Active Wars,
move directly to the Combat Phase immediately after the Victory Condition is triggered (if needed). The Rebel may
immediately add to his Army any remaining Forces in the Active Forces boxes, including the remainder of the defeated
Senate Army, if any (i.e. if the Rebel won a Senate Defeat battle), along with all remaining Roman Fleets. In the order
of his choosing, he then immediately prosecutes the Wars one at a time. If the Rebel [dies](#1107-commander-death)
in the last necessary battle, his faction may still win the Game (the Revolt is over, so it cannot fail due to the death
of the Primary Rebel at this time). However, if he dies, he may not prosecute any more battles. If he is unable to bring
the number of active wars to fewer than 4 because he lacks the necessary Fleets to support his Army to continue
prosecuting Wars, or does not gain a Victory after each battle, all players lose the Game. If he gains a Victory in
enough Wars to reduce the number of Active Wars to fewer than 4, he wins.

## 1.13 ADDITIONAL CARD NOTES
### 1.13.1 VATINIAN LAW
During the Revenue Phase, a Province controlled by a Legate is treated exactly the same as if that Governor was present.
Governors may not move between their Province(s) and the Senate. Corrupt Governors using Legates are eligible for
a Minor Prosecution for each Province in which Provincial Spoils were taken and may only be Prosecuted the turn they
take it (while in Rome). There is no marker for Governors that are ruling via Legates; it is suggested that you place
a Negative Number marker on the Province to indicate that the Governor is not present.

- [Provincial Wars Advanced Rule](#202-provincial-wars): If a Governor is not physically present in a province,
  he may not add his Military rating to a battle.
- [Rebel Governor Advanced Rule](#203-rebel-governors): If the Governor of more than one Province Rebels,
  he must pick the current Province he is in. The remaining Provinces return to the Forum.

### 1.13.2 GRACCHI & LICINII BROTHERS
No Senators with the same ID# can be in play at the same time, except for the Gracchi brothers (Statesmen 25A and 25B)
and the Licinii (Statesmen 29A and 29B) in the later scenarios. Should the 25 or 29 Mortality Chit be drawn when both
its respective Statesmen are in play, the Senator affected is determined by a random 2d6.

If two Statesmen brothers with the same number are in play and the Family card then appears in the Forum,
the Family card is placed under the “A” Statesman of the pair. A player may not play one of these Statesmen if
the Family card is in play with a different Faction, unless the other Statesman of the pair is already in play.
If one of the pair dies, and the Family card is with the other, the Family card is moved to the surviving Statesman.

### 1.13.3 TRIBUNES
Tribune cards may be played during the Senate Phase to veto or initiate proposals, including nominations. Once used,
Tribunes are discarded. If two or more players play a Tribune at the same time, those players dice off to determine
who gets precedence with the loser(s) taking their Tribune(s) back to their hand(s).

#### 1.13.3.1 PROPOSAL USING A TRIBUNE
Other Senators may force proposals to a vote only by using a Tribune card and announcing “Tribune!”. A proposal
is considered on the floor the moment the first vote is called for. The Presiding Magistrate may call for the votes
of each Faction in any order. The proposal must still be made at the correct time in the Senate Phase
(e.g., a player may not propose to recruit Legions before the Censor has been elected, or propose to elect a Dictator
after the Censor has been elected). This may be done any time there is no proposal already on the floor. Alternatively,
it can be played during a current proposal with or without specifying intent so as to establish that player’s right
to make the next proposal. Other facts about Tribunes:

- A Tribune may not be used to interrupt an already played Tribune (i.e., once a Tribune has been played to make
  a proposal, another Tribune may not interrupt it).
- A Tribune can not be used to veto the closing of the Senate, as this is not a vote.
- A Tribune can be played immediately after the Presiding Magistrate adjourns the Senate to force its continuation
  to consider the Tribune’s proposal.
- A Tribune may not be used to make a proposal to adjourn the Senate; however, a proposal could be put forth to send
  the Presiding Magistrate to war, which, if it passes, would close the Senate upon the Presiding Magistrate’s
  [departure](#109642-departure-of-a-presiding-magistrate).
- A Tribune can be used in the middle of a vote that would send the Presiding Magistrate off to war
  (thus closing the Senate Phase) before or during his turn to vote - not as a veto, but as a measure to suspen
  the vote until after his proposal has been acted upon. If the proposal put forth from this Tribune results in making
  the suspended Deployment proposal invalid (e.g., the troops no longer exist), the suspended proposal automatically
  fails.
- Some Statesmen have the capability of playing an inherent Tribune each turn without actually playing a card.
  Treat this ability exactly the same as if the Faction had played a Tribune card.
- A Tribune can not be used to veto the nomination of a Consul for Life.
- If a Tribune is used to propose Consul for Life, it may, however, be cancelled by an appropriate Intrigue card
  (e.g., Graft).
- A Senator who vetoes a Land Bill with a Tribune is not penalized (the way he would be if voting against the Bill)

#### 1.13.3.2 VETO USING A TRIBUNE
A Tribune may be used prior to or during the owning Faction’s turn to vote to stop any vote from being taken, whether
it is an election, Prosecution, or other proposal. However, it can not be used to veto the nomination of a
Consul for Life, the Special Prosecution of Assassins, any proposal by a Dictator, nor the appointment of the last
eligible candidate for any office.

The Senator playing the Tribune announces “Veto,” and the vote is cancelled, even if it already had enough votes
for passage. The slate of candidates in a vetoed election may not be nominated again in the same turn, nor may
the Accused in a vetoed Prosecution be prosecuted again that turn for the same reason.

#### 1.13.3.3 TRIBUNES DURING PROSECUTIONS
A Tribune may be played by anyone to veto the Prosecution. The vetoed Prosecution still counts towards
the Censor’s total allowed Prosecutions for that Game Turn. A Prosecution cannot be proposed with a Tribune.
A Senator who makes a Popular Appeal and is not killed as a result may play a Tribune to veto the Prosecution
after discovering the result of his appeal.

## 1.14 FAQ
##### Can the Land Commission Concession be assigned when ther is no Land Bill in effect ?
The Land Commission Concession may only be assigned if a Land Bill is in effect; once assigned it must be returned
to the Forum if there are no Land Bills in effect at the end of a Senate Phase.

##### Do Veteran Legion still count double when not under the control of their designated Commander ?
Veteran Legions count double in combat regardless of which Senator owns their Allegiance.

##### Are Legions lost in Naval Battles / Fleets lost in Land Battles ?
If Land Forces accompany Fleets on a Naval Battle, the Land Forces still take losses normally. Fleet losses always
apply whether the Fleets were active in a Naval Battle or simply used for Fleet Support.

##### Does a Commander die when he loses is entire Force ?
A Commander who loses his entire Force is not necessarily harmed as a result of losses taken, unless it was a Defeat
or his Mortality Chit has been drawn as a result of losses taken. If the Primary Rebel loses all his Forces, though,
the revolt fails and he dies as a result.

# II. ADDITIONAL RULES
## 2.01 PONTIFEX MAXIMUS
### 2.01.1 OVERVIEW
The Pontifex Maximus is a Major Office that allows the holder to assign Priesthoods and veto proposals without
a Tribune. This Advanced Rule adds minimal complexity and is highly recommended.

### 2.01.2 ELECTION
Unlike normal offices, the Pontifex Maximus office is held for life unless it is stripped by a Senate vote,
multiple Evil Omens, or Prosecution. If, during the Senate Phase, no Senator holds the Pontifex Maximus office,
a Pontifex Maximus is elected immediately after the two Consuls but before a Dictator appointment or election,
to look after Rome’s religious affairs. The candidate must be an Aligned Senator in Rome. The elected Senator places
the Pontifex Maximus marker on his card and increases his Influence by 5, but gains no further Influence in succeeding
turns for holding the office.

### 2.01.3 PRIESTHOODS
During the Senate Phase of each Game Turn, except during a vote, the Pontifex Maximus may assign or reassign
a Priesthood to any one Senator present in Rome, unless there are no Senators left without a Priest marker.
He may not assign or reassign a Priest to himself.

#### 2.01.31 INFLUENCE
The announcement of the new Priesthood may be made at any time during the Senate Phase, and the nominee immediately
places a Priest marker on his card and increases his Influence by 1. A Senator may hold only one Priest marker,
but this does not bar him from holding any other office. When a Priesthood is reassigned, the Senator who loses
the office must decrease his Influence by 1 (to a minimum of 0).

#### 2.01.32 PRIEST BATTLE INFLUENCE
Every Priest receives one extra vote when voting on a proposal that will send Forces against a War or recall/retain
their Commander. This does not include any proposals that only contain the deployment of Garrisons or Governors.

### 2.01.4 PONTIFEX MAXIMUS BATTLE INFLUENCE
The Pontifex Maximus doubles his personal votes (including those of his Knights but not those bought with Talents)
when voting on any proposal that will send Forces against a War or recall/retain their Commander. This does not include
any proposals that only contain the deployment of Garrisons or Governors.

### 2.01.5 VETO
Once each Senate Phase during or prior to his Faction’s turn to vote, the Pontifex Maximus may cast a veto without
the use of a Tribune card. He can veto (but not propose) anything that could normally be vetoed with a Tribune.

### 2.01.6 COLLECTIONS
During the Revenue Phase, the Pontifex Maximus receives 1d6 Talents in addition to his normal
[base income](#10611-base-income).

### 2.01.7 EVIL OMENS
When the Evil Omens event is drawn, the Pontifex Maximus must pay the 20 Talent cost from his Personal Treasury.
If he cannot pay the 20 Talents or if a second Evil Omens occurs in the same turn, he is immediately stripped
of his office, gets a Major marker, and loses 5 Influence (to a minimum of 0). If he is unable to pay the full
Evil Omens cost, the difference plus a 10 Talent fine is levied on his Faction Treasury (payable to the Bank).
If the Faction Treasury has insufficient funds, what money there is in that Treasury is lost, and the ancient Pontifex
may also be the subject of a Major Prosecution during the following Senate Phase, in addition to any regular
Prosecutions the Censor may wish to conduct. The State must pay any shortfall in the Evil Omens cost
(excluding the Faction fine) not paid by the Pontifex Maximus or his Faction.

### 2.01.8 RECALL
The Pontifex Maximus may be stripped of his office during any Senate Phase by a two-thirds majority of votes cast.
He may not veto that proposal with the Pontifex Maximus veto ability, although any Senator (of his or another Faction)
wielding a Tribune may. If voted out of office, he loses 5 Influence (to a minimum of 0). Existing Priests
are not affected in any way by the recall or death of the Pontifex Maximus.

## 2.02 PROVINCIAL WARS
### 2.02.1 OVERVIEW
Provincial Governors may now raise/maintain local Forces and command Garrisons, which may be used to defend
the Province from attacking Wars. This Advanced Rule adds a medium level of complexity. The Provincial Wars rules should
only be used once players have a good understanding of the Basic Rules.

### 2.02.2 TAXES
The [Provincial Spoils](#10613-provincial-spoils) and [State Income](#10651-taxes) derived from Provinces remains
the same as in the Basic Game. However, an additional Local Tax income is generated immediately after the State pays
its [debits](#10653-debits) in the Revenue Phase for the purpose of raising Provincial Forces.
Local Taxes may be supplemented by the Governor, but are never decreased or stolen. Local Taxes must be spent the turn
they are generated and cannot be saved.

### 2.02.3 FORCES
The Province’s Governor spends the Talents raised by Local Taxes immediately after the State pays
its [debits](#10653-debits) in the Revenue Phase. It costs 10 Talents to build an Army or Fleet.
He must build as many Forces as possible, but may choose the types. An Unaligned Governor will raise Forces
in equal proportions, with Armies getting preference in the case of an odd number of builds. The maximum number
of Provincial Forces that each province may raise is defined on the Province card. Note builds by adjusting
the Provincial Forces dials on the Province card. Provincial Forces cost nothing to maintain unless controlled
by a [Rebel](#203-rebel-governors).

#### 2.02.31 GARRISONS
As in the Basic Game, the Senate may, as a normal
[Force deployment proposal](#109646-base-province-strength-and-garrisons), send Legions to a Governor to serve
as a Garrison that will stiffen a Provincial Army. Garrisons require maintenance by the Senate, not the Province.

#### 2.02.32 PROVINCIAL ARMY STRENGTH
Provincial Armies are counted at full value as long as a Garrison or Rebel Legion accompanies them at the start
of the battle. Otherwise, Provincial Armies count as half (fractions rounded up) a Legion. Note that
the [Base Province Strength](#109646-base-province-strength-and-garrisons) of a Province is considered separately
from Provincial Armies and is not halved.

### 2.02.4 PROVINCIAL WARS
Whenever an Active War appears that names Provinces under “Defends,” those Provinces are considered under attack
(if they exist and are loyal to Rome). All of these listed Provinces lose
all [Provincial Spoils](#10613-provincial-spoils) and all [Taxes](#10651-taxes), including the [Local Tax](#2022-taxes).
They may maintain their existing Provincial Forces for free, but may build no new ones. At the end of any Combat Phase,
but before Unprosecuted Wars are moved to the [Unprosecuted Wars](#1109-unprosecuted-wars) spaces,
the first Roman-controlled Province for each War must attack that War (unless a Roman Force sent by the Senate this turn
has achieved a Stalemate, Standoff, or Victory against it). If multiple Provincial Wars exist, randomly determine their
[resolution order](#1048-resolving-ties--turn-order).

#### 2.02.41 COMBAT
The Roman-controlled Province must attack the War, plus any Matching Wars, with Strength equal to
its [Base Province Strength and Garrisons](#109646-base-province-strength-and-garrisons), plus
its [Provincial Army Strength](#20232-provincial-army-strength), plus the Military rating of its Governor.
If the War requires only a Land Battle, Provincial Fleets are not required but must be fully committed to battle,
if available (i.e., they may take losses). If the War requires Fleet Support, a Province lacking the necessary Fleets
to support its battle against a War must still attack, but any “Victory” result obtained is treated as a “Stalemate”
instead (losses remain the same). Any War requiring a Naval Battle that cannot be fought results in an automatic
”Defeat”. Combat is resolved in the normal fashion, except for [Losses](#202411-taking-losses).

##### 2.02.411 TAKING LOSSES
It takes 2 Provincial Armies to satisfy 1 combat loss, unless a Garrison Legion was present at the beginning
of the battle (in which they count as 1 loss each). Provincial Fleets take losses normally. When eliminating Forces
consisting of a combination of Garrison Legions and Provincial Armies, 2 Provincial armies are always lost first,
followed by 1 random Garrison Legion. Continue with the 2 Provincial, 1 Garrison pattern until the required number
of losses has been taken (e.g., 5 losses will equate to 6 Provincial Armies and 2 Garrison Legions).

##### 2.02.412 DEFEAT
A “Defeat” in a Land or Naval Battle results in the death of the Governor. The Province becomes allied with
the victorious War, combining with it to increase the Strength of the latter by the printed Strength of the Province
card and all remaining Provincial Forces. Any surviving Roman Forces are returned to Rome. However, because this was
a Provincial Defeat rather than a Roman Defeat, the Unrest Level is not further affected. The surviving
Provincial Forces increase the Strength of the War by one for each Army/Fleet but are not affected by multipliers
for Matching Wars. These Provincial Armies/Fleets must be removed as losses first (at normal, not double, rate)
in any subsequent battles. They must match Roman/friendly Provincial losses on a one-to-one basis in
Stalemates/Standoffs and Naval Victories. However, they take no losses as a result of Roman/Provincial
Defeats/Disasters. The Province may not build additional Forces while allied with a War. Once this War is defeated
by a non- Governor Commander, it returns to the Forum all allied Provinces, now to its Undeveloped side,
and with no Provincial Forces.

##### 2.02.413 STALEMATE/STANDOFF
A result of “Stalemate” or ”Standoff” is treated as no effect other than the loss of any called for Provincial Forces
and the resulting Mortality Check for the Governor. The War is still considered Unprosecuted.

##### 2.02.414 VICTORY
A result of “Victory” in a Land Battle (or a Naval Battle if the War has no Land Strength) by a Governor turns the War
into an Inactive War, provided there is presently no Active Matching Wars or Leader in the Forum.
If this War has allied Provinces augmenting its Strength, these Provinces stay allied until defeated by
a non-Governor Commander. In this case, the defeated War does not incur an Unprosecuted War penalty during
the Population Phase. It will stay Inactive until attacked by Rome or made Active by another Matching War or Leader.
If there is already an Active Matching War or Leader in the Forum, the War is shuffled into the top six cards
of the deck. If there are only six cards left, it is shuffled into the top of the next deck (in the case of
an Extended Scenario) or discarded outright (if this is the last deck). A Provincial Victory has no effect on
the Unrest Level and no Spoils of War are gained. Governors that win a Provincial Victory (Land or Naval) receive
the standard Influence and Popularity gains. Veteran Legions are created from Garrison Legions
(Provincial Armies cannot become Veteran) and owe allegiance to the Governor. A result of “Victory” in a Naval Battle
that still requires a Land Battle results in a Naval Victory marker being placed on the War, and the War is considered
Prosecuted for that turn.

## 2.03 REBEL GOVERNORS
### 2.03.1 OVERVIEW
Provincial Governors may now use their local Forces and Garrisons to Revolt against the Senate. This Advanced Rule
adds a high level of complexity and should only be used once players have a very good understanding of the Basic Rules.
The Provincial Wars Advanced Rule (2.02) must be used in conjunction with this Advanced Rule.

### 2.03.2 REBEL GOVERNOR DECLARATION
Governors may Revolt during the Revolution Phase, during the [Declaration of Civil War](#1113-declaration-of-civil-war).
Starting with the HRAO’s Faction and proceeding clockwise, each Faction may declare a single Victorious Commander
and/or one or more Governors to be in Revolt. If a Victorious Commander is declared a Rebel, he must be
the Primary Rebel, otherwise, any Rebel Governor may be the Primary Rebel. The Primary Rebel may be joined by any number
of Secondary Rebels belonging to the same Faction. Should a Faction that wishes to Revolt field a stronger Force than
that of a previously declared Rebel, the initial Rebel’s declaration is ignored, and the player with the stronger Force
is considered in Revolt instead. Determine the Force Strength for this purpose as follows:

Primary Rebel’s Military rating
+1 per Garrison Legion belonging to Rebel Governors
+1 per Provincial Army/Fleet belonging to Rebel Governors
+1 per successfully diced for Roman Fleet / Legion [[Victorious Commander](#11131-commander-allegiance) only]
+2 per successfully diced for Veteran Legion [[Victorious Commander](#11131-commander-allegiance) only]
+2 per Veteran Legion belonging to any [Rebel Senator](#20321-secondary-rebels) (at Rebel’s discretion).

#### 2.03.21 SECONDARY REBELS
Governors belonging to the same Faction as the Primary Rebel may also go into Revolt, bringing their Provincial Forces,
Garrison Legions, and Province with them. Additional non-Governor Senators belonging to the Rebel’s Faction may also
join the Revolt in support of the Primary Rebel, as in the [Basic Game](#11132-secondary-rebels).

#### 2.03.22 LEGION/ARMY ALLEGIANCE
Provincial Armies and Garrison Legions automatically owe allegiance to the Rebelling Governor. If the Rebel Governor has
any active Veteran Legions, they immediately desert to him (regardless of where they are). If there are Veteran Legions
of a loyal Senator in the Rebel Army, the loyal Senator may instruct his Legions to desert to the Senate’s Army
at any time (even right before battle).

#### 2.03.23 FLEET ALLEGIANCE
A Victorious Commander attempting to Revolt may dice for the loyalty of the Fleets under his command as if they were
[Legions](#11131-commander-allegiance) and must pay maintenance for those that remain loyal to him. He may forfeit their
control to the Senate if he prefers not to pay for them. Provincial Fleets automatically owe allegiance to
the Rebelling Governor. A declaring Rebel may still land his Army in Italy before declaring his Revolt and in doing so
avoid a [Naval Interception](#20372-naval-interceptions), therefore a Fleet is not always necessary.

### 2.03.3 REBEL PROVINCIAL STRENGTH
When in Revolt, Provincial Armies are counted at full value only if a Garrison/Rebel Legion accompanies them at
the start of battle. Otherwise, Provincial Armies count half (fractions rounded up). Provincial Fleets are always
full Strength.

### 2.03.4 REBEL PROVINCE EXCEPTIONS
A Rebel Province is never considered under attack by any Wars in play (the Wars simply ignore them).
It always [generates Revenue](#2035-rebel-governor-income); however, it cannot be Developed and cannot be affected
by Random Events. All Rebel Governors adjust their term dials to show nothing, and they retain control
of their Provinces until defeated or killed.

### 2.03.5 REBEL GOVERNOR INCOME
A Governor in Revolt is not subject to recall but loses all Concessions, Knights, and Aligned Senatorial Income.
He must collect all Provincial Spoils and State and Local Taxes of his Province, which are transferred to his
Personal Treasury.

### 2.03.6 REBEL PROVINCIAL MAINTENANCE
A Rebel must pay 2 Talents per Provincial Army/Fleet, Legion/Fleet, and for each point of Strength in the Province’s
printed Base Province Strength for maintenance. He may pay using Talents from his Personal Treasury,
his Faction Treasury, or the Personal Treasuries of other Rebel Senators. Veteran Legions owing allegiance to
a Rebel Senator require no maintenance. If, during the Revenue Phase, the Rebel cannot pay the required maintenance
he must first release non- provincial Legions/Fleets until he can afford to pay the maintenance. Any non-provincial
Legions/Fleets that are released in this manner may be returned to the State. If the HRAO does not wish the State
to pay (or the State cannot) the maintenance costs of these Forces, they are immediately eliminated.
If, after releasing all non-provincial Legions/Fleets, the Rebel still cannot pay his maintenance costs,
he must release Provincial Armies/Fleets until he can afford to pay the maintenance. If he still cannot pay,
he simply pays all of his money (but does not lose any printed Base Province Strength points).

### 2.03.7 MARCHING ON ROME
After the Rebel Faction has been decided upon, the Primary Rebel must immediately decide if he will March on Rome.
When a player declares multiple Rebel Senators in Revolt, the Forces of only the Primary Rebel may March on Rome.
A Primary Rebel that is a Victorious Commander must March on Rome. A Primary Rebel Governor may decide to March on Rome
or remain in his [Rebel Province](#2038-staying-in-the-province). If the Primary Rebel Governor elects to
immediately March on Rome, he does not have to make a [Naval Interception](#20372-naval-interceptions)
(his Forces just land) but he may never return to his Province (though he still collects Income and Taxes).
His Land Strength is equal to all his Provincial Armies [halved in value if not accompanied by
a [Legion](#2033-rebel-provincial-strength)], loyal Veterans and Garrison Legions. If he Marches on Rome,
he may not use his Province’s Base Province Strength, which remains behind on the Province. The Revolt itself
is resolved as in the [standard rules](#11137-combat-resolution) except for [Reinforcements](#20371-reinforcements)
and [Naval Interceptions](#20372-naval-interceptions).

#### 2.03.71 REINFORCEMENTS
At the beginning of every Revolution Phase following a Combat Phase where a Primary Rebel Marched on Rome achieves
a “Stalemate” result, one (and only one) Secondary Rebel Governor may attempt to reinforce the Primary Rebel’s Army
in Italy with any Forces he currently commands. This reinforcement does not count as an additional War, rather as
an expansion of the current Civil War. The reinforcements are automatically added to the Primary Rebel’s Army if
the Rebel Province has a [Base Province Naval Strength](#109646-base-province-strength-and-garrisons) of 0.
If the Province has a Base Province Naval Strength greater than 0, then the reinforcements are considered to be
“in transit.” Reinforcements in transit are added to the Primary Rebel’s Army only if it avoids
[Naval Interception](#20372-naval-interceptions) at the beginning of the next Combat Phase. The Senate cannot attack
a [Rebel Province](#20381-attacking-a-rebel-province) if that Province has already transported Forces to Italy
or has Forces in transit.

#### 2.03.72 NAVAL INTERCEPTIONS
When a Governor from a Rebel Province attempts to land in Italy or reinforce the Primary Rebel in Italy on a turn
after he declares his Revolt, the Forces are subject to a Naval Interception by the Senate if
its Base Province Naval Strength is greater than 0. Naval Interception battles are resolved before all other battles.
The Rebel’s Naval Strength consists of the Province’s Base Province Naval Strength in addition to any Provincial Fleets
belonging to the reinforcing Province and all Fleets controlled by the Primary Rebel (Military ratings are not used).
Provincial Fleets are always counted at full Strength. The Senate’s Strength is equal to the number of Fleets in
the Active Forces boxes. If the Rebel suffers a Defeat in the Naval Interception, all his Forces remain in
the Rebel Province, minus those lost in the Naval Battle. On any other result (including Stalemate), they land in Italy
to attack or reinforce. Battle losses are taken equally from each side for every combat result other than “No Losses”
and “ALL”. Only Fleets are subject to such losses, Mortality Chits are not drawn, and this battle has no effect
on Unrest. If the Rebel has a combination of Provincial and non-Provincial Fleets, they take losses in the same way
that Provincial Armies/Garrison troops [take losses](#202411-taking-losses). Provincial Fleets losses can come from
either the Primary Rebel’s Forces or the reinforcing Rebel Province (Rebel’s choice).

### 2.03.8 STAYING IN THE PROVINCE
If a Primary Rebel Governor remains in his Province, he cannot win due to the failure of the Senate to send an Army
against him or even for defeating the Army the Senate [sends against him](#20381-attacking-a-rebel-province). He can,
however, still win if the [People Revolt](#1082-state-of-the-republic) or the State Treasury goes
[Bankrupt](#10653-debits). His War (in combination with all Secondary Rebels) count as one of the 4 Active Wars needed
to destroy Rome and costs the State 20 Talents per turn. The Rebel Governor’s Strength is equal to
the Province’s Base Province Strength plus all Provincial Forces, loyal Veterans and Garrison Legions,
and Fleets he has. In a future Revolution Phase during [Declaration of Civil War](#1113-declaration-of-civil-war),
the Primary Rebel can decide to March on Rome. If the Province has a Base Province Naval Strength greater than 0,
the Senate can attempt to prevent the Primary Rebel from landing in Italy
by [Naval Interception](#20372-naval-interceptions). If the Senate does not send an Army to attack
the Primary Rebel Governor remaining in his Province, that Revolt is considered Unprosecuted and will increase Unrest
per the [normal rules](#1109-unprosecuted-wars).

#### 2.03.81 ATTACKING A REBEL PROVINCE
Rome can attempt to defeat a Rebel Governor occupying a rebel Province by attacking his Province. Rome cannot attack
a Province if the Governor is [marching on Rome](#2037-marching-on-rome) or in transit to reinforce an existing
[Primary Rebel](#20371-reinforcements). When attacked at his rebel Province a Rebel Governor’s Land Strength is equal
to the sum of his:

[Base Province Land Strength](#109646-base-province-strength-and-garrisons)
+1 per Provincial Army (count half Strength if no Garrison Legions are present)
+1 per Garrison Legion
+2 per Veteran Legion
+Military rating of [Rebel Governor](#11011-land-battles)

Fleet Support might also be required to fight the Land Battle. The Rebel’s Fleet Support is equal to the sum of:

Base Province Naval Strength
+1 per Provincial Fleets
If the Rebel Governor’s Fleet Strength exceeds the Undeveloped Base Province Land Strength of the Province (even if it is Developed), a Naval Battle must be fought first (unless the maximum number of fleets that Province can build is 0).
The Rebel Governor’s Fleet Strength is equal to the sum of the following:
Base Province Naval Strength
+1 per Provincial Fleets
+Military rating of [Rebel Governor](#11011-land-battles)

> EXAMPLE: Sardinia et Corsica is fully Developed and in Revolt. Its full complement of 1 Provincial Army
> and 5 Provincial Fleets added to its Base Province Strength of 1 Land Strength and 0 Fleet Strength gives it a total
> of 2 Land Strength and 5 Fleet Strength. Because its Fleet Strength is greater than its Land Strength, Rome must
> defeat it in a Naval Battle before attacking it on land. If Rome defeats it while losing 3 fleets,
> the Sardinia et Corsica Fleet is also reduced by 3 and the Rebel Province gets a Naval Victory marker.
> The new Strength of Sardinia et Corsica for the impending Land Battle is 2 Land Strength and 2 Fleet Support.
> Rome must commit 2 Fleets to that battle in support of its Land Forces.

### 2.03.9 RESOLUTION
The resolution of a Rebel Governor combat is the same as the [normal Game](#11137-combat-resolution)
except for the following:

#### 2.03.91 SENATE VICTORY
If the Senate attacks and defeats a Rebel Governor in a Naval Battle, that Rebel Province gains a Naval Victory marker.
If the Senate attacks and defeats a Secondary Rebel Governor in a Land Battle, that Governor is killed and the Province
is returned to the Forum Undeveloped with no Forces. The Civil War will continue until the Primary Rebel is killed,
either through a defeat in [Marching on Rome](#2037-marching-on-rome), or through a defeat in
a [Land battle in a Rebel Province](#20381-attacking-a-rebel-province), or through
a [Mortality Chit draw](#10521-mortality-resolution). Once the Primary Rebel dies, all remaining Rebel resistance
collapses, Secondary Rebels are automatically killed and their Provinces are returned to the Forum Undeveloped with
no Forces.

#### 2.03.92 REBEL VICTORY
If the Rebel Army attacks the Senate in Italy and achieves a “Victory” result, the Revolt has succeeded and the Rebel
now rules Rome and wins the Game, barring [the collapse of the Republic](#1123-survival). If he defeats
the Senatorial Army attacking him in his Rebel Province, he does not win the Game. For the Primary Rebel to win he must
successfully attack the Senate in Italy or he may wait in his Province and hope for
a [“People Revolt”](#1082-state-of-the-republic) result or a [Bankruptcy of the State Treasury](#10653-debits).

## 2.04 LEGIONARY DISBANDMENT & RECALL
### 2.04.1 OVERVIEW
Commanders with the Allegiance markers of Veteran Legions may now gain Influence and Oratory by disbanding
these Legions. These Advanced Rules add minimal complexity and can be used once players have some familiarity
with the Basic Rules.

### 2.04.2 DISBANDMENT
When it is his turn to [play cards](#1111-play-statesmenconcessions), a Victorious non-Rebel returning Commander
may disband any commanded Veteran Legions for which he holds the Allegiance markers. The identities
of the disbanded Legions are noted by retaining their Legion Allegiance markers on his card and flipping them
to their disbanded side. The Legions are then placed in the Bank (not the available Force Pool) with
their Veteran side up. For each Legion disbanded, the Senator increases both his Oratory and Influence by 1.
When a Senator who holds the Allegiance marker of any disbanded Legion dies, his disbanded Legions are placed
in the available Force Pool and lose their Veteran Status.

### 2.04.3 RECALL
A Consul or Dictator may recall his disbanded Veteran Legions from the Bank during
the [Senate Phase](#10963-recruitment-of-forces) by paying 10 Talents per Legion from his Personal or Faction Treasury
(No Recruitment and Manpower Shortages do not affect the ability or cost to recall Legions). For each Legion he recalls,
the Senator flips its Allegiance marker on his card and decreases both his Oratory and Influence by 1. Recalled Legions
retain their Veteran status and must be maintained by the Senate at the normal rate.

Once all the remaining Legions from the available Force Pool have been raised, the Senate may also raise
disbanded Legions from the Bank. Disbanded Legions raised in this way may no longer be recalled by their Senator
(give the Legion Allegiance marker back to the Bank) and no longer have Veteran Status.

## 2.05 ADVOCATES
### 2.05.1 OVERVIEW
Prosecutions now have “Trials” where both the Censor and an Advocate debate with Oratory to influence the verdict.
This Advanced Rule adds a moderate level of complexity and can be used once players have a good understanding
of the Basic Rules.

### 2.05.2 APPOINTING AN ADVOCATE
Immediately after the post of Prosecutor is filled for a [Prosecution](#109411-prosecutor) the Accused may ask
one Senator, belonging to any player (including himself), to represent him in the trial as an Advocate.
A Senator must be in Rome and cannot hold the position of Censor or Prosecutor in order to be eligible to be
an Advocate. The Censor must give the Accused a reasonable amount of time to obtain the services of an Advocate.
If no Advocate comes forward to represent the Accused, he is considered to be his own Advocate
and is representing himself.

### 2.05.3 TRIAL VOTES
The [Prosecution](#109411-prosecutor) is carried out as normal. After the votes are announced the Advocate rolls 2d6,
adding the Advocate’s Oratory while subtracting the Prosecutor’s Oratory. This modified die roll is cross-referenced
with the Trial Appeal Table to determine how many extra votes are added or subtracted on behalf of the Accused.
The Trial must be conducted (unlike the Popular Appeal, which is still optional).

- Trial Votes = Advocate’s Oratory – Prosecutor’s Oratory + 2d6
- Final Verdict = Popular Appeal Votes + Accused’s Influence + Senate Votes + Trial Votes

### 2.05.4 POPULAR APPEAL
The rules for Popular Appeal are not changed, except that when a result of 2 or less is achieved, the Accused
is automatically killed by the angry mob, and for each number that the modified 2d6 result is less than 3
a Mortality Chit is drawn to see if the Advocate (the only one vulnerable to the chit draw) is also killed by
the angry citizens of Rome. No chits are drawn if the Accused was representing himself.

### 2.05.5 GUILTY
If the verdict is “Guilty,” the penalties and rewards are carried out exactly as in the normal Game, except that
the Advocate (provided it is not the Accused representing himself) loses 3 Influence, regardless of the type
of Prosecution (to a minimum of 0). If the Accused is representing himself (and thus is his own Advocate) and
the verdict is Guilty, the penalties and rewards are unchanged from the normal Game.

### 2.05.6 INNOCENT
If the verdict is “Innocent,” the Advocate (provided it is not the Accused representing himself) gains 3 Influence,
regardless of the type of Prosecution. The Prosecutor also loses 3 Influence (to a minimum of 0). If the Accused
is representing himself (and thus is his own Advocate) and the verdict is Innocent, the Prosecutor still loses
3 Influence, but the Accused gains nothing.

## 2.06 PASSING LAWS
### 2.06.1 PASSING LAWS
Laws are now treated like regular Proposals, which may be put forward by Senators and which award Influence
if successfully passed. These Advanced Rules add only a slight level of complexity and can be added once players
have some familiarity with the Basic Rules.

### 2.06.2 ENACTING LAWS
In order to be enacted a Law must be voted upon by the Senate and passed. Law cards may be proposed by a Senator
at anytime during the Senate Phase, even before the Consuls are elected. If played in the middle of
a Proposal resolution, it will automatically be the next Proposal. The player of the card does not have to be
the Presiding Magistrate and is able to put the passage of the Law forward as a Proposal without the use of a Tribune.
The Presiding Magistrate still controls the order and speed of the vote.

The player of the card names two consenting Senators in Rome to be the Sponsor and Co-Sponsor. The sponsor
and co-sponsor need not belong to the Faction playing the card. This vote cannot be vetoed and assassinating
the Sponsor or Co-Sponsor does not stop the vote Once enacted, the provisions of the Law apply as normal, although
several Laws have slightly different effects (as noted on the card) when using this rule. Display Enacted Law cards
as you would normally in the Law Box. If the Law fails, it is discarded from the game.

### 2.06.3 REWARDS FOR ENACTING
If enacted, the sponsoring Senator gains 3 Influence, while the Co-Sponsor gains 1 Influence. However, the law goes
into effect before the Influence is awarded.

### 2.06.4 DISCARD PROHIBITION
A Law card cannot be discarded voluntarily by a player during the [Revolution Phase](#1112-excess-faction-cards).
If a player’s hand rises above 5 cards in the Revolution Phase, he must discard a non-Law card unless he has only
Law cards.
# III. SCENARIOS

*REPUBLIC OF ROME offers three main scenarios which cover Rome’s rise from a city-state on the banks of the Tiber to an empire that dominated the entire Mediterranean. The main scenarios are labeled the Early, Middle, and Late Republic. The Early Republic features a fragile Republic beset by the most powerful enemies it would ever have to face, and the players must work hard simply to survive. The Middle Republic is a period of growth, in which a stable Rome absorbs more and more provinces, and the threats it faces slowly become more internal than external. The Late Republic portrays the final cataclysmic days of the Republic, as powerful politicians face-off for control of the state while Italy is wracked by dissent, Civil War threatens, and the Roman Republic lurches towards the Roman Empire.*

*It is generally suggested that new players should start with the Early Republic scenario (3.01.1). Even though it is the toughest for the Republic, it plays in 4 hours or so for most groups. It uses the fewest rules and is an excellent way to become familiar with the dynamics of the game. The Middle and Late Republic scenarios each take a bit longer to play than the previous scenario, although the very real threat of the Republic becoming an Empire can cut the Late Republic short.*

## 3.01 EARLY REPUBLIC SCENARIO
### 3.01.1 EARLY REPUBLIC SCENARIO OVERVIEW
Below are the steps for setting up the Early Republic Scenario. The other Scenarios will reference this setup procedure.

### 3.01.2 GAME BOARD
Place the Game Board so that each player has space off-board to display his Faction’s cards.
Give each player a Faction Treasury Box

### 3.01.3 MARKERS
Place the 36 Mortality Chits in an opaque cup suitable for random draws. The State Treasury starts with 100 Talents.
The Unrest Level starts at 0.

### 3.01.4 CARDS
Set up the Early Republic (white) deck as follows:

1. Start with the white-bordered cards.
2. Place the 1st Punic War card in the Inactive Wars section of the Forum.
3. Separate the 20 black-text Family cards and randomly deal 3 face-up to each player.
   Return all the remaining Family cards to the Early Republic deck.
4. Shuffle the Early Republic deck and deal out 3 cards face-down to each player. Players should keep any Faction card
   they get, but any Forum card should be discarded face-up when received and replaced with another card.
   Repeat until all players have a hand of 3 hidden Faction cards. Shuffle the discarded Forum cards
   back into the Early Republic deck.
5. Separate 6 random cards from the Middle Republic (gray) deck and combine them with 6 random cards from
   the Early Republic deck along with the “Era Ends” card. Shuffle these cards and place them at the bottom of
   the Early Republic deck.
6. Put the remaining Middle and Late Republic (red) decks aside.
7. Place the finished Early Republic deck in the Draw Pile space on the Game Board.

### 3.01.5 LEGIONS
Four Legions are put in the Active Forces boxes.
### 3.01.6 TEMPORARY ROME CONSUL
Draw a Mortality Chit from the cup. If the ID# drawn does not match an existing Senator put it to the side and
draw again until a matching ID# is drawn. The matching ID# is Temporary Rome Consul until new Consuls can be elected
during the first Senate Phase. Place the Rome Consul and Prior Consul markers on his card and add 5 to his Influence.
Place all the Mortality Chits back into the cup.

### 3.01.8 PROVINCES
No Provinces are currently in play.
### 3.01.9 INITIAL FACTION PHASE
Each player (starting with the Temporary Rome Consul and proceeding clockwise) may play any Statesmen or Concessions
from his hand, if he wishes. Faction cards may not be traded until the first Revolution Phase.

## 3.02 MIDDLE REPUBLIC SCENARIO
### 3.02.1 MIDDLE REPUBLIC SCENARIO OVERVIEW
The setup for the Middle Republic is the same as the Early Republic, except for the following:

### 3.02.2 CARDS
Set up the Middle Republic (gray) deck as follows:

1. Start with the gray-bordered cards.
2. No cards are placed in the Forum.
3. Separate and combine the 25 black-text Family cards from the Early (white) and Middle Republic decks and randomly
   deal 4 face-up to each player. Return all the remaining Family cards to the Middle Republic deck.
4. Add the 13 Concessions cards from the Early Republic deck to the Middle Republic deck.
5. Separate and shuffle all the non-Statesman Faction cards from the Early Republic deck.
   Randomly draw 6 Faction cards from this pile and add them to the Middle Republic deck without looking at them.
6. Shuffle the Middle Republic deck and deal out 3 cards face-down to each player. Players should keep any Faction card
   they get, but any Forum card should be discarded face-up when received and replaced with another card.
   Repeat until all players have a hand of 3 hidden Faction cards. Shuffle the discarded Forum cards back
   into the Middle Republic deck.
7. Separate 6 random cards from the Late Republic (red) deck and combine them with 6 random cards from
   the Middle Republic deck along with the “Era Ends” card. Shuffle these cards and place them at the bottom of
   the Middle Republic deck.
8. Put the remaining Early and Late Republic decks aside.
9. Place the finished Middle Republic deck in the Draw Pile space on the Game Board.

### 3.02.3 LEGIONS
Six Legions are put in the Active Forces boxes.

### 3.02.4 PROVINCES
Shuffle the Undeveloped Province cards of Sicilia, Illyricum, Sardinia et Corsica, Hispania Citerior, Hispania Ulterior,
and Gallia Cisalpina and deal 1 to each player, with any remaining being placed in the Forum. Each player assigns
his Province to one of his Senators and sets the term dial to 1, 2, or 3 turns (his choice).

## 3.03 LATE REPUBLIC SCENARIO
### 3.03.1 LATE REPUBLIC SCENARIO OVERVIEW
The setup for the Late Republic is done the same as the Early Republic, except for the following:

### 3.03.2 CARDS
Set up the Late Republic (red) deck as follows:

1. Start with the red-bordered cards. Add the Middle Republic Statesmen cards Marius [27A] and Sulla [1C].
2. No cards are placed in the Forum.
3. All Law cards from the Middle Republic (gray) deck are placed in the Laws space and considered in play
   [EXCEPTION: the Serviliani and Acilian Laws are removed from the Game].
4. Separate and combine the 30 black-text Family cards from the Early (white), Middle, and Late Republic decks
   and randomly deal 5 face-up to each player. Return all the remaining Family cards to the Late Republic deck.
5. Add all 13 Concessions cards from the Early Republic deck to the Late Republic deck.
6. Separate and shuffle all the non-Statesman Faction cards from the Early and Middle Republic decks.
   Randomly draw 6 Faction cards from this pile and add them to the Late Republic deck without looking at them.
7. Shuffle the Late Republic deck and deal out 3 cards face- down to each player. Players should keep any Faction cards
   they get, but any Forum card should be discarded face-up when received and replaced with another card.
   Repeat until all players have a hand of 3 hidden Faction cards. Shuffle the discarded Forum cards back into
   the Late Republic deck.
8. Separate 10 random cards from the Late Republic deck and add the “Era Ends” card. Shuffle these cards and
   place them at the bottom of the Late Republic deck.
9.  Put the remaining Early and Middle Republic decks aside.
10. Place the finished Late Republic deck in the Draw Pile space on the Game Board.

### 3.03.3 LEGIONS
Eight Legions are put in the Active Forces boxes.

### 3.03.4 PROVINCES
the Developed Province cards of Sicilia, Illyricum, Sardinia et Corsica, Hispania Citerior, Hispania Ulterior,
and Gallia Cisalpina and deal 1 to each player, with any remaining being placed in the Forum.
The Undeveloped Province cards of Gallia Narbonensis, Cilicia et Cyprus, Macedonia, Africa, and Asia are likewise
distributed. [EXCEPTION: In a six-player Game, each player [rolls dice](#1048-resolving-ties--turn-order) to determine
who will not receive a Governorship.] Each player assigns his Province to one of his Senators and sets the term dial
to 1, 2, or 3 turns (his choice).

## 3.04 EXTENDED SCENARIO
### 3.04.1 EXTENDED SCENARIO
Rather than simply playing one scenario, continue into the Middle (or Late) Republic by shuffling the second
(or third) deck from that period and placing it in play. Players may play just two decks
(Early to Middle or Middle to Late) or opt for the complete extended Game (Early to Middle to Late).
Play proceeds normally after noting the increased Legion Loyalty numbers for [Revolts](#11131-commander-allegiance) and
the new Random Events Table column in use for the new period. The Game is considered to be in the Middle or Late period
the moment a card is drawn from that deck (the drawing player must announce he drew from the new period).
Setup should be done for the first deck only according to the starting Scenario for that deck, except that the placement
of the “Era Ends” card should be done by using the Era Ends placement rule for the ending Scenario deck.

> EXAMPLE: If doing the Extended Scenario from the Middle to Late scenarios, follow all the steps in
> the Middle Republic Scenario (3.02) except for steps (3.02.2 G and 3.02.2 H). Instead, use step (3.03.2 H) from
> the Late Republic Scenario (3.03) to place the Era Ends card.

## 3.05 ALTERNATIVE HISTORY SCENARIO
### 3.05.1 ALTERNATE HISTORY SCENARIO
Set up the Game exactly as the [Early Republic Scenario](#301-early-republic-scenario), except ignore all deck borders
[e.g., deal out 3 random black-text Family cards (from any scenario) and 3 random Faction cards (from any scenario)].
The deck will consist of all 3 decks shuffled together. The Random Events column and Legion Loyalty Numbers will advance
at the start of the 8th and 16th turns. Randomly shuffle the “Era Ends” card into the last 12 cards of
the combined deck.
